<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>This week, my colleague <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/xprts.html#kitain" rel="nofollow">Roger
Kitain</a> and I are sitting in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_van_Pelt" rel="nofollow">virtual advice
booth</a>, however, instead of doling out <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lucy_and_the_psychiatric_help_booth.jpg" rel="nofollow">psychiatric
help</a> we're answering JSF questions.</p>

<p>Please stop by at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/</a>
and ask some questions.</p>

<p>My community support time that I normally spend on <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/JavaServerFacesSpecFaq#ChatRoom" rel="nofollow">the
JSF IRC channel</a> is consumed with these questions this week, so you
probably won't see me on the channel this week.&nbsp; However, other weeks
please visit the channel and you can chat with me directly.</p>
