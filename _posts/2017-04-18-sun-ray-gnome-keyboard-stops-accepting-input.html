<p>I was happily using my Sun Ray session one day and then it stopped
accepting keyboard input.  Nothing I tried could make anything other
than the BEL sound happen.  After posting to an internal list at Oracle
carried over from the Sun days, the ever helpful and
venerable <a href="https://twitter.com/alanc">Alan Coopersmith</a> clued
me in.  I must have held the shift key down for five seconds, turning on
the "only accept long keypresses" feature.  This is great for people
with Parkinson's but thankfully I'm not there yet.  But it's nice to
  know GNOME has my back.</p>

<p>If you run into this problem you can disable it by going to
System::Preferences::Keyboard, in the Accessibility tab, and ensuring
the "Slow Keys" checkbox is not checked.</p>

<p>You may also want to uncheck "Accessibility features can be toggled
with keyboard shortcuts.</p>
