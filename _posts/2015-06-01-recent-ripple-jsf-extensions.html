<div class="jive-rendered-content"><h1>Recent Ripple of JSF Extensions</h1>&nbsp; <p>My colleague <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.java.net/blogs/mriem" rel="nofollow">Manfred Riem</a> tipped me off to a new framework built on JSF, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.butterfaces.org/" rel="nofollow">ButterFaces</a>.&nbsp;
 This whimsical name started an amusing Twitter thread, but also, and 
much more importantly brought several other new JSF extensions to light.
 This is the sort of thing that I used to look to Kito Mann's <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jsfcentral.com/products/frameworks/" rel="nofollow">JSF Central Frameworks Page</a>
 for, but it seems that needs an update.&nbsp; So, in addition to 
ButterFaces, here are several other JSF extensions that are definitely 
worth a look.</p>&nbsp; <p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.bootsfaces.net/" rel="nofollow">BootsFaces</a> focuses on Twitter Bootstrap 3 and jQuery UI.</p>&nbsp; <p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.materialprime.com/" rel="nofollow">Material Prime</a> is a PrimeFaces extension that lets you build web apps that conform to Google's "Material" design language.</p>&nbsp; <p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.generjee.com/" rel="nofollow">Generjee</a>
 is a Java EE application generator that outputs JSF+JavaEE 7+CDI 
code.&nbsp; FWIW, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/projects/javaee-spec/pages/JEE" rel="nofollow">there is nothing named JEE</a>.&nbsp; So, I suggest this project rename itself to generee.&nbsp; I think that's snappier anyway.</p>&nbsp; <p>This
 recent flurry of activity shows two things.&nbsp; First, the continuing
 vitality of the JSF ecosystem.&nbsp; By now I think we all know that 
the ecosystem around the technology is just as important as the 
technology itself.&nbsp; It's like this.&nbsp; A technology has to be 
"good enough" to get the job done.&nbsp; That's a given.&nbsp; Heck, it 
could even be excellent technology.&nbsp; But without an ecosystem 
around it, even the best technologies will not survive.&nbsp; Second, 
there is still interest and value in server side state UI 
frameworks.&nbsp; My recent work with HTTP/2 in Servlet 4 has shown me 
that such frameworks are very well positioned to take advantage of the 
optimizations in the HTTP/2 protocol, as well as other performance 
optimizations shown in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/igrigorik" rel="nofollow">Ilya Grigorik's</a> excellent <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545" rel="nofollow">High Performance Browser Networking</a>.</p>&nbsp; <p>So, check out these new frameworks and don't be afraid to question conventional wisdom.</p>
