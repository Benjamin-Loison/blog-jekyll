<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I
 estimate that this is my 15th or 16th JavaOne.&nbsp; I started in 1998 
or 1999 and missed 2003 due to the birth of my first son.&nbsp; Aside 
from that, I haven't missed one since.&nbsp; I consider myself very 
blessed to have taken a small part in such a long and fun ride.&nbsp; To
 add blessing on top of blessing, this is the fourh JavaOne at which I 
have had the honor to teach a class at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/java-university/index.html#JavaEE7" rel="nofollow">Java University</a>.&nbsp; My good friend <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://sourceknights.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Oliver Szymanski</a>
 and I repeated our class from last year, updated with new 
content.&nbsp; We had 16 students, and they were fully engaged, learning
 about JSON, WebSocket, JSF and HTML5.&nbsp; After the class, which ran 
from 09:00 - 16:00, Ollie and I took in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.oracle.com/openworld/keynotes/" rel="nofollow">Oracle OpenWorld Keynote</a>
 and then headed over to the GlassFish party at ThirstyBear.&nbsp; This 
event has stood the test of time, becoming the one time of the year when
 the leading lights of the Java Community come together to compare notes
 and set plans for the big week ahead.&nbsp; The real action starts 
tomorrow.&nbsp; My agenda includes giving my <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5989" rel="nofollow">Servlet 4.0 talk with Shing-Wai Chan</a> and my <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=4241" rel="nofollow">JSF 2.3 talk with Manfred Riem, Ian Hlavats and Kito Mann</a>, in addition to the requsite booth duty from 09:30 - 12:00.</p> </div>
