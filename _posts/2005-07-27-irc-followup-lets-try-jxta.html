<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>To follow up to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/07/lets_hear_it_fo_1.html" rel="nofollow">my previous blog</a> about the desire for irc.java.net, I'd like to talk about using <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jxta.org/" rel="nofollow">Project JXTA</a> in the interim (and perhaps indefinately, if people like it) to fill the gap.</p><span></span><p>Shortly after posting the above blog, I was contacted by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blogs.sun.com/gonzo" rel="nofollow">James Todd</a> about the possibility of using MyJXTA as a distributed chat service. I tried it out, and it seems to fit the bill pretty well.</p><span></span><p>So, I've created a public jxta group called <strong>jsfaces</strong>. You can join by using Java WebStart and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://download.jxta.org/build/nightly/jnlp/myjxta.jnlp" rel="nofollow">clicking on this link</a>.</p><span></span><p>In
 my opinion, the number one advantage JXTA has over old school IRC is 
the ability to easily tunnel through HTTP using the standard java 
control panel proxy settings. In this way companies like <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oracle.com/" rel="nofollow">Oracle</a>, with firewalls that only permit HTTP to traverse, can participate in the chat.</p><span></span><p>I hope to see you all in the <strong>jsfaces</strong> chat room!</p><span></span><p>In any case, please continue to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java-net.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=149" rel="nofollow">vote for irc.java.net</a>, even if you try out JXTA.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
