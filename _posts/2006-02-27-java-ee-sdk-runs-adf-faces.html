<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The saga of Oracle ADF Faces on the Java EE SDK continues. In our last installment, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://sfjsf.blogspot.com/2006/02/adf-faces-and-jsf-12.html" rel="nofollow">Adam Winer explained why ADF Faces won't run on Glassfish</a>.
 I'm happy to report that after some minor tweaks to Sun's JSF 
implementation in the Java EE SDK, I think I have it running. However, I
 would appreciate any testing people could give to see if the entirety 
of ADF Faces works. ADF Faces is a large piece of software and their 
demo app is rather comprehensive. Incidentally, it's also a great 
testcase for extending JSF and exposed a few bugs which have also been 
fixed.</p><span></span><p>Here's how to try it. I'm using the jsf-glasssfish-updater technique described in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2006/01/glassfish_jsf_1.html" rel="nofollow">an earlier blog</a>.</p><span></span><ol><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Download and install the Java EE 5 SDK.</a> If you already have JDK 5.0 installed, you can just download <code>Sun Java System Application Server PE 9 Beta</code>. Currently there is no Mac OS X build of the Java EE SDK, but don't despair! Mac Users will have to use <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/downloadsindex.html" rel="nofollow">Glassfish</a>,
 the Open Source Application Server from which the Java EE SDK is built.
 Mac OS X is my main development platform, so I know it works there.</p></li><li><p>Go to the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=1703" rel="nofollow">the nightly download area</a>. If you're running the Java EE SDK Preview, download the <code>jsf-sjsas9pebeta-updater.jar</code>. If you're running Glassfish, download<code>jsf-glassfish-updater.jar</code></p></li><li><p>Execute this with the JDK 5 Java interpreter.</p><pre>java -jar jsf-&lt;glassfish-or-sjsas9pebeta&gt;-updater.jar &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_ASINSTALL_DIRECTORY&gt;
</pre><p>Where <code>&lt;glassfish-or-sjsas9pebeta&gt;</code>sjsas9pebeta or glassfish, and<code>PATH_TO_YOUR_AS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY</code> is the parent of the<code>lib</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>domains</code> (and so on) directories.</p></li><li><p>Download Oracle ADF Faces from <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/partners/addins/exchange/jsf/" rel="nofollow">Oracle's website</a>. Note, you have to join their developer network to get it.</p></li><li><p>Unfortunately, ADF Faces appears to have been developed without taking advantage of the benefits of the robust <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/security/jacc/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">SecurityManager</a> in Java EE 5. Therefore, you'll have to put the following entry in your <code>server.policy</code> file if you want the <code>chooseDate</code> component to work from the<code>adf-faces-demo.war</code>.</p><pre>grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/domains/domain1/applications/j2ee-modules/adf-faces-demo/WEB-INF/lib/adf-faces-api-SNAPSHOT.jar" {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission java.net.NetPermission "specifyStreamHandler";
};
</pre><p>Of course, you'll have to tweak the entries if you use the 
components in your apps. Also of note, the Sun App Server team has been 
debating turning the security manager off by default, so this step may 
not be necessary in the future.</p></li><li><p>Make sure any attempts to deploy a previous version of<code>adf-faces-demo.war</code> have been completely removed from the App Server. For example, I have noticed that occasionally the<code>adf-faces-demo</code> directory stick around in<code>domains/domain1/applications/j2ee-modules</code>. I had to manually remove this directory to enable the demo to work.</p></li><li><p>From the ADF Faces download, deploy the<code>adf-faces-demo.war</code> to your running Java EE SDK App Server and visit the demo to enjoy ADF Faces on Java EE 5!</p></li></ol><span></span><p>If you find any bugs when trying the demo please file them on the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues" rel="nofollow">JSF issue tracker</a> or the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues" rel="nofollow">Glassfish issue tracker</a>.</p><span></span><p>Also, note that this version of JSF includes the new<code>invokeOnComponent</code> feature we developed with help from Jacob Hookom and mentioned <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jhook/archive/2006/02/new_feature_for.html" rel="nofollow">in his blog</a>. Lastly, the jsf jars in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/nonav/repository/javax.faces/jars/" rel="nofollow">java.net Maven 1 Repository</a> have been updated as well.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>

Ed you have saved me.<br>

Without you I would never have been able to deploy an adf application to glassfish.

I have posted a more recent successful attempt to deploy adf faces in glassfish:<br>
http://mariosgaee.blogspot.com/2009/12/glassfish-and-adf-faces.html<br>

along with another successful attempt to deploy Adf Toplink Ejbs 10g here:<br>
http://mariosgaee.blogspot.com/2009/12/glassfish-and-adf-toplink-10g.html<br>
and here<br>
http://mariosgaee.blogspot.com/2009/12/glassfish-and-adf-toplink-part-2.html<br>

keep up the very good work!<br>
glassfish rocks!
