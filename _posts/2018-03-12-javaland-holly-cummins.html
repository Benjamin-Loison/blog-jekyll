<p>Holly leads the "Cloud Garage" at IBM, working with customers to
  create solutions when moving to the cloud.</p>

<p>Holly gives the summary of the "Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"
  movie.</p>

<p>Story of the hero who wanted to make the world better, but ended up
  making some mistakes.</p>

<p>Cites Joseph Campbell, who observed the commonalities among the
world's myths.  He finds the recurring themes among them.  He formed the
idea of the "monomyth".  There is actually only one story: the
  quest.</p>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>all to action
	  </p></li>

     	  <li><p>obstacles
	  </p></li>
          
         <li><p>reward
	  </p></li>

	</ul>

<p>Observes we are the hero of our own story.</p>

<p>Some aspects of being that with respect to being a developer.</p>

<p>Listed some rockstar programmer skills: automate, tools mastery, etc.</p>

<h2>Hero stories for the cloud</h2>

<p>Long deploy times.</p>

<h2>But what about the obstacles</h2>

<p>Adoption is still not complete.  Relates this to the hero's "call to
  action".</p>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>Security fears</p>

            <p>Bank: Watson discovery.  The crawler that populates the
              ML by putting all the data in the cloud.</p>

            <p>But you must encrypt it.</p>

            <p>In the traditional stack, the dev is responsible for the
            security of their code.  In the cloud, the entire stack,
            including the OS, is the built artifact.  So the developer
            must take responsibility for OS patches, and everything on
            up through the stack.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>Cloud-nativeness</p>

            <p>Definition: it's not just centralized computing.</p>

            <p>History lesson: tty, mirocomputer, client-server, PC,
            Grid computing, laptops, cloud, edge computing.  She used a
              sine wave to cover what I often depict as a pendulum.</p>

            <p>CNCF: Containerized, Dynamically orchestrated, microservices
              oriented.</p>

            <p>Holly adds: elasticity and agility, as well as assuming
              everything is unreliable.</p>

            <p>JVM considerations: the traditional Rafael Benevides
              concerns: containers get killed.</p>

            <p>Logging: the need for data analytics simply to get access
              to the logs.  Prometheus.</p>

            <p>Microservices are hard.  They seem like a great idea, but
            when you try them.  Here is where she brings back in the
              meatball movie.</p>

            <p>Cost for Kubernetes clusters, especially if you fail to
              tear them down when you are done.</p>

            <p>Needing a cloud to manage your cloud.</p>

          </li>

	</ul>

        <h3>Trends</h3>

<p>QaaS quantum as a service</p>

<p>renewed interest in IaaS because the I can have super expensive
  hardware, such as GPU loaded machines.</p>

<h3>Cloud Native Thinking</h3>

<p>Digital Native analogy</p>
