<div class="jive-rendered-content"><h1>JavaLand 2015 Early Adopter's Area</h1><p>With only 25 business days to go until JavaLand 2015, now's a good time to share the plans for the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/index.php?id=1786" rel="nofollow">Early Adopter's area</a>
 and Hackergarten. As at many other Java community conferences, this is a
 space where anyone can visit and meet with leaders of different parts 
of the Java ecosystem to see first hand what's new in their own little 
patch of the Java world. The detail page for this space on the JavaLand 
website: &lt; <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/index.php?id=1786" rel="nofollow">http://www.javaland.eu/index.php?id=1786</a>
 &gt; lists the individuals who have committed to spend some time in the
 space. I've been participating in these kinds of spaces <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2006/08/im_lucy_van_pel.html" rel="nofollow">for nearly ten years now</a> and it's always very worthwhile for me to interact with the community in this way.</p><p>The
 schedule of mini-presentations is still not yet finalized, but the 
detail page will have the final schedule when it is. In the meantime, I 
can share an alphabetical snapshot of the current set of individuals and
 their topics. If I have any commentary to add for each entry, I'll add 
it. As I prepared the commentary, a theme emerged. Every one of these 
individuals is passionately advocating for their ideas in the face of 
some form of challenge. I see individuals who are trying to displace an 
incumbent technology, trying to overcome some part of the community "not
 getting" their idea, and fighting the old bugbear of 
complexity/indifference. This passion makes it worth your time to stop 
by the early adopter's area.</p><dl><dt>Alex Snaps, Peter Lawrey</dt><dd><p>Alex and Peter are talking about JCache and Data Grids</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p></dd><dt>Anatole Tresch</dt><dd><p>Apache Tamaya, Java Configuration, and Money and Currency</p><p>Anatole
 has been super determined to make progress on the configuration for 
Java effort. This effort started out as an Oracle-lead JSR proposal, was
 transferred to Anatole's employer, Credit Suisse, was declined for 
consideration in both EE and SE JCP executive committees, and Anatole 
finally decided to make progress as an Apache Incubator Project. I 
applaud his tenacity.</p></dd><dt>Andres Almiray</dt><dd><p>Andres is 
most famous for his involvement in the Griffon desktop application 
framework, but his passion for this space has lead him to propose <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=377" rel="nofollow">JSR-377: A Desktop Application API</a>.
 Now, I've been around long enough to know that this is a difficult 
space to occupy, with several attempts at standardization having come 
and gone (see <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=295" rel="nofollow">JSR-295</a>, and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=296" rel="nofollow">JSR-296</a>, and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=143" rel="nofollow">JSR-143</a>). I wish you the best of success with this one, Andres, but it's obviously a tough nut to crack.</p></dd><dt>Dan Allen</dt><dd><p>I
 know Dan from his productive involvement in JSF 2.0. These days I see 
him frequently tweeting about Asciidoctor. After having just made a <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://github.com/edburns/http2-spec/commit/08c4b1376354801f9e5abfe144b3696191b4194e" rel="nofollow">trivial pull request to the HTTP/2 spec</a> and using <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/" rel="nofollow">xml2rfc</a> to do it, I can say there is room for improvement in this space, and I know that Dan can tell you all about it.</p></dd><dt>Ed Burns</dt><dd><p>I'll be here talking about JSF, Servlet, and HTTP/2.</p></dd><dt>Heather Vancura</dt><dd><p>Heather
 is the heart of the JCP, and therefore has her finger on the pulse of 
what is happening across the evolution of the entire Java platform.</p></dd><dt>Ivar Grimnstad</dt><dd><p>I
 don't know Ivar, but he is on the MVC Expert Group, and is thus a great
 conduit to the development efforts of one of only two new JSRs in Java 
EE 8.</p></dd><dt>Mani Sarkar, Daniel Bryant</dt><dd><p>I've seen Mani 
at several conferences over the past couple years, and he epitomizes the
 passionate Java developer. As the late night tech conversations would 
dwindle off, he'd always be one of the last ones still talking hard core
 tech. Mani's the real deal. Mani is talking about OpenJDK, among other 
things.</p></dd><dt>Roland Huss</dt><dd><p>Roland is talking about JMX and Java EE Management.</p></dd></dl><p>Please drop by the Early Adopter's Area to catch up with these and other Java community leaders!</p></div>
