<p>The web is not doing that well right now.</p>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>Censorship
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Bullying
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Trolling
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Malware
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Bloat
	  </p></li>
          

	</ul>


<p>He thinks bloat is a big problem.  He liked the simplicity of the
  early web.</p>

<p>Most of the new end users are on mobile devices.</p>

<p>The web was not ready for the mobile form factor.  Initially the
  mobile web was a throw back to the early web.</p>

<h2>The publisher's dilemma</h2>

<p>On the web, users are in control.</p>

<p>Users are contitioned to not pay for things but find ways around
  paying.</p>

<p>Somehow you have to pay the bills</p>

<h2>Publishers like apps</h2>

<p>Control look and feel</p>

<p>Revenue resource</p>

<p>Built-in obsolescence</p>

<p>Control the environment, iOS first, android maybe</p>

<h2>Reality check for publishers</h2>

<p>Pricing race to the bottom</p>

<p>Lock-in to the marketplace</p>

<p>Revenue share with marketplace/OS</p>

<p>Updates are hard and may be delayed by marketplace rules.</p>

<p>94% of app revenue comes from 1% of publishers</p>

<p>80% of users who download an app fail to become active users.</p>

<p>In-app purchases are where the money is.</p>

<p>60% of the apps in the Google Play app store have never been
  downloaded.</p>

<h2>Tips for making better mobile web apps: PWA Progressive Web Apps</h2>

<p>Small initial payload</p>

<p>Form factor supporting interfaces: big buttons</p>

<p>High contrast</p>

<p>Support offline/flaky connection</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the power of the end user device</p>

<p>Avoid interaction latency</p>

<p><b>Chris let drop several pearls of wisdom during his talk about how
he interacts with the digital world that left me with the desire to
learn more about them.  For example: ad blocking and VPN location
spoofing, how to serve your site over https.  People need to know how to
do these things. </b></p>

<p>App Manifest, and Service Worker.</p>

<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>Great analogy: escalator</p>

<p>The great thing here is that progressive web apps is that it brings
  back the power of the link.</p>
