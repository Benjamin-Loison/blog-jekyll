Frankly, it's a crying shame that you're making this plea. Minimally, 
it's a crying shame that you're making this plea this late in the game, 
that there STILL are, apparently, no good sample applications for JSF.

In the past I looked long and hard for something useful. If I had found 
some, perhaps I would be using JSF today in my daily work. But, there 
were none to be found, and the tutorials and NB app wizards give 
different, conflicting, views on the same problem. You look at the code 
used in the tutorials and the code used by the wizards, and they're not 
even close to style and concepts.

Do I bind to simple values or do I bind to controls? Which is better? 
Why should I choose one over the other? How do "real" folks do it? 

Disaster.

MS has had this issue nailed solidly to the floor since forever. Their 
"starter kits" are incredible for the beginning ASP .NET user. They're 
not just "wizard" demos, but functioning and powerful, yet accessible, 
applications for novice users to modify and learn from.

When I was looking for a Java framework, Stripes sold me because of it's
 "Bugzooky" sample application. It had the bulk of the fundamentals of a
 basic web app. Security, CRUD, List pages, simple CRUD workflow, and 
pleasant UI. It showed how someone "puts together" a Stripes 
application, much better than any Javadoc or simple action/binding 
tutorial ever could.

Yet, here we are, after how many years since JSF came? And the call goes
 out only NOW? There's "better late than never", but, man, this barn is 
empty.

As a casual observer of JSF, it's the most confusing thing I've seen. 
It's still unclear to me the state of "pure" JSF vs Faces or Seam or ADF
 or what. I don't even know if "raw" JSF that comes with GF is usable or
 not, or is that the JSF that everyone complains about while praising 
some other JSF manifestation.

I hope y'all can get the cats herded and present a more solid front for 
JSF 2.0, and hopefully give it the rebirth that JSF (to me) seems to 
need. And I wish you all the best in trying to find a good solid sample 
application.

Because JSF sorely needs it.

Wow, there's candor! Keep in mind that JSF has always been a 
specification intended to be implemented by others in the community. 
Although there is the RI (Mojarra), I think the bulk of the momentum for
 JSF has been in the 3rd party implementations. IBM and Oracle, for 
example, have latched pretty heavily onto the toolability of JSF and 
have used JSF as a launchpad for value-added products. MyFaces has been 
very successful on the open-source side, and Woodstock and JMaki have 
been growing pretty strong with the inclusion in NetBeans. 

Point is, JSF as a single, one-size-fits-all solution has been diluted 
by the sheer variety of how its been implemented. This makes creating a 
single PetStore sample application difficult, both since the would-be 
authors/developers are often on a derivative project and the user base 
is sprawled across so many different implementations.

This does not mean there shouldn't be a definitive example for Mojarra; I
 just think the real-world has gotten in the way. I also think much of 
the time and effort has been put into things like the Java EE Tutorial 
and Blueprints, which in my opinion are equally, if not more, valuable.

I'm not sure "Disaster" is necessarily accurate. Despite not having such
 a sample application, JSF has successfully permeated the market. There 
isn't an IDE that doesn't have tools for JSF, and there are many many 
developers who have learned proper usage without the aid of such an 
example app. I agree that the community my have struggled more than it 
needed to, but let's keep things in perspective.

Did i just read someone standing up for ASP.NET?&nbsp; hahaahaa.&nbsp; 
good luck with all that.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Greetings Ed. I feel bad I lost your business card but we spoke at FOWA 
2008 in Miami last year. Sorry about this off topic question I am 
posting. Feel free to delete after reading.

I remember speaking to you about my project which is essentially 
researching the art of building websites that can protect themselves 
from spyware. The Spyshakers project.

I have a javascript security question. Here is my question:

Say we have a web page that populates a simple html text box with a 
basic javascript string concatenation:

document.myForm.myTextBox.value = document.myForm.myTextBox.value + "B";

Can a rogue executable (running locally) monitor the javascript 
execution and observe that the text entered into myTextBox was indeed B?

I can find lots of information on how the operating system is protected 
from malicious javascript. Protecting javascript from a malicious 
executable is a lot harder to find information on.

My email is gaf@spyshakers.com. Again sorry to post off topic.
