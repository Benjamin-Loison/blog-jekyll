<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Way
 back in October 2002, I had the enviable position of ramping up the 
development effort for the Sun RI for JavaServer Faces. At that time, 
Test Driven Development (TDD) was just starting to catch on, and I used 
my position as team leader to mandate (HA!) that we would use TDD on the
 project. I realized that for any mandate to succeed, it must be easy to
 implement, so the team and I invested in building the infrastructure 
iteratively growing our test codebase. I can't tell you how many times 
that investment has paid off, but I'll tell you one time: right now.</p><span></span><p>While implementing Adam Winer's proposal for fixing the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11" rel="nofollow">State Saving Window Id</a>
 problem, I came across a corner case not covered explicitly in the 
proposal. Basically, the proposal re-allocated some responsibilities and
 neglected to re-allocate this one corner case, which happened to be 
caught in an <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">HTMLUnit</a>
 test, written by Craig, I think. Unfortunately, the net effect of this 
neglect was to throw the webapp into an infinite loop. It was very easy 
to re-produce: just visit the prefix mapped webapp and include only the 
servlet-mapping with no trailing slash and no viewId. Thanks to the unit
 test, I quickly found and fixed the problem, without introducing the 
bug into the code.</p></div>
