<div class="jive-rendered-content"><h1>JavaLand Training Day Teaser</h1><p>With
 only 61 days to go until JavaLand 2015, it's high time for a preview of
 the Training Day session I am pleased to offer with my friend Oliver 
Szymanksi. Briefly, this session is a full day treatment of the parts of
 Java EE 7 that intersect with the world of HTML5 web development.</p><p>While the session is an update of the successful class we offered at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/java-university/index.html#JavaEE7" rel="nofollow">JavaOne San Francisco 2014</a>, it is not a simple repeat. Some major things have happened in the world of HTML5 since JavaOne 2014. Most notably, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.w3.org/2014/10/html5-rec.html.en" rel="nofollow">HTML5 has gone final</a>. In case you missed it, many things that were slated for inclusion in HTML5 have been descoped, as detailed in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html" rel="nofollow">Plan 2014</a>
 document from W3C. The idea is to reduce HTML5 spec size by splitting 
things into seperate specification efforts. Formerly core ideas such as 
the 2D Canvas, Web Storafe, WebSocket, Server Sent Events and WebRTC 
either already had their own specification effort or now have one. The 
Plan 2014 document justifes this move with some compelling anecdotal 
data, summing it up with this defensive statement, “The evidence shows 
that placing technologies in their own extension specifications, while 
initially controversial in some cases, has proven to be a long-term 
benefit for peace and harmony in the end.” Peace and harmony? I hope so.
 In any case, Oliver and I will break this down and show you what it 
means for developers using Java EE 7.</p><p>Here is the basic outline of the session.</p><p>Morning session WebSocket, JSON, JSF</p><ul class="mondo-grey listicons"><li>JSON<br> - Why is this important? JSON is to HTML5 what XML was to web services<br> - JSON-P is for parsing<br> - What about binding to Java Objects?</li><li>WebSocket<br>- Three specs: JavaScript API, IETF transport protocol, Java API<br> - Java API details: Usage from a browser, Usage from standalone client</li><li>JSF: The good parts<br> - Composite components<br> - HTML 5–friendly markup</li></ul><p>Afternoon session: HTML 5 Deep Dive</p><ul class="mondo-grey listicons"><li style="line-height: 1.3em;">HTML 5: Why all the fuss?<br> - What's in a name?<br> - Is it really a big deal?</li><li>HTML 5: High-level perspective<br> - Design goals<br> - How does it differ from HTML 4</li><li>HTML 5: Subspecifications<br> - Browser contexts<br> - Microdata<br> - Canvas context<br> - Offline apps<br> - Messaging<br> - Events<br> - Cross-document messaging<br> - Server-sent events<br> - WebSocket<br> - Drag and drop<br> - Web storage</li></ul><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/" rel="nofollow">JavaLand 2015</a> has much to offer aside from just this training day, so please consider attending!</p></div>
