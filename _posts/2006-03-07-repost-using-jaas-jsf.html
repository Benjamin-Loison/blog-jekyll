<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The content and ideas in this blog entry are taken from my upcoming McGraw Hill Osborne book <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://purl.oclc.org/NET/jsfbook/" rel="nofollow">JavaServer Faces: The Complete Reference</a>, which I am co-authoring with <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jroller.com/page/cschalk" rel="nofollow">Chris Schalk</a>.
 In the book, we have a chapter on Securing JavaServer Faces 
applications. This excerpt shows how the extensible design of JavaServer
 Faces can be used to allow JAAS to provide authentication to a JSF Web 
application. JAAS Authorization with JSF is also covered in the book, 
but not in this excerpt.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="border:1px solid black;"><p>We
 will conclude this chapter by showing how to enhance the example 
application by leveraging the standard security infrastructure of the 
Java platform. From its inception, the Java platform has treated 
security as a first class concern. Indeed, one of the first benefits of 
Java was to securely bring dynamic behavior to web deployed 
applications. Over the years, the implementation and API to security has
 evolved, but the core principals have improved and become steadily more
 secure. Therefore, choosing to build your application managed security 
on top of the standard Java security features is a very safe bet.</p><p>A
 term often applied to Java security is JAAS, which is short for Java 
Authentication and Authorization Service. JAAS started out as an 
optional package in JDK 1.3 but has become a core part of the Java 
platform as of JDK 1.4. As the name implies, JAAS covers the first two 
of the three main aspects of security: authentication and authorization.
 Let's explore one way to integrate JAAS style authentication and 
authorization into the application</p><h2>Using JAAS Authentication in the example application</h2><p>While
 it would certainly be possible to call into the JAAS layer directly 
from the example application logic, for example, from the UserRegistry 
bean, a more re-usable solution is to encapsulate the<strong style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff;">JAAS</strong>
 interface in a custom ActionListener. This approach de-couples the 
security completely from your application and takes advantage of the 
intended use of the ActionListener extension hook.</p><p>The mechanics 
of providing such an ActionListener are described in Chapter 11, but 
let's review briefly here. The first step is to modify the 
faces-config.xml file for the example reusable component library so that
 it includes the action-listener declaration, as shown here.</p><pre><code>&lt;application&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;action-listener&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.jsfcompref.examplecomponents.util.JAASActionListener
&nbsp; &lt;/action-listener&gt;
&lt;/application&gt;
</code>
</pre><p>Then, leverage the decorator pattern, as described in Chapter 
10, to delegate most of the work to the "real" ActionListener by 
providing a constructor that saves a reference to it. Following the 
constructor, the processAction( ) method must be implemented, as 
described below.</p><pre><code>private ActionListener parent = null;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
public JAASActionListener(ActionListener parent) {
&nbsp; this.parent = parent;
}

public void processAction(ActionEvent event)
&nbsp; throws AbortProcessingException {
&nbsp; FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
&nbsp; UIOutput comp = null;
&nbsp; String userid = null, password = null;
&nbsp; JAASHelper jaasHelper = new JAASHelper();
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; // Check to see if they are on the login page.
&nbsp; boolean onLoginPage = (-1 != context.getViewRoot().getViewId().
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lastIndexOf("login")) ? true : false;
&nbsp; if (onLoginPage) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (null != (comp = (UIOutput) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; context.getViewRoot().findComponent("form:userid"))) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; userid = (String) comp.getValue();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (null != (comp = (UIOutput) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; context.getViewRoot().findComponent("form:password"))) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password = (String) comp.getValue();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If JAAS authentication failed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!jaasHelper.authenticate(userid, password)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; context.getApplication().getNavigationHandler().
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handleNavigation(context, null, "login");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Subject must not be null, since authentication succeeded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert(null != jaasHelper.getSubject());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Put the authenticated subject in the session.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; context.getExternalContext().getSessionMap().put(JAASSubject, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jaasHelper.getSubject());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; parent.processAction(event);
}

</code>
</pre><p>The first thing to note is that part of the usage contract for 
JAASActionListener is the requirement that the username and password 
components be nested inside a UIForm named "form", and be named "userid"
 and "password" respectively. This expedient measure allows the 
JAASActionListener to easily extract the user-provided values for 
username and password so that they can be passed on to the JAASHelper 
class. The second thing to note about the usage contract is the 
requirement that the application provide a navigation rule for the 
outcome "login" that causes the user to be directed to the login page if
 the authentication failed. In the failure case, processAction( ) is not
 called until after redirecting to the "login" outcome using 
NavigationHandler. If authentication succeeded, the Subject is stored in
 the session for later access. The java.security.Subject is the Java 
class that represents the user to the runtime. (We'll cover Subject in 
greater detail in the section on JAAS authentication.) Finally, the 
parent processAction( ) method is called to do the normal action 
handling. Note that this causes the existing application managed 
authentication, as described in Chapter 9, to take place. A production 
quality implementation would probably remove the application managed 
authentication in favor of using JAAS, rather than just supplementing 
it, as we have done here.</p><p>Let's examine the JAASHelper class.</p><pre><code>public class JAASHelper {
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; LoginContext loginContext = null;

&nbsp; public JAASHelper() {
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; public boolean authenticate(String userid, String password) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean result = false;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loginContext = new LoginContext("FileLogin", 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new LoginCallback(userid, password));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loginContext.login();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result = true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch (LoginException e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // A production quality implementation would log this message
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result = false;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return result;
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; public Subject getSubject () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject result = null;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (null != loginContext) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result = loginContext.getSubject();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return result;
&nbsp; }
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; public static class LoginCallback implements CallbackHandler {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String userName = null;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private String password = null;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public LoginCallback(String userName, String password) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.userName = userName;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.password = password;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void handle(Callback[] callbacks) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (int i = 0; i&lt; callbacks.length; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (callbacks[i] instanceof NameCallback) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NameCallback nc = (NameCallback)callbacks[i];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nc.setName(userName);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else if (callbacks[i] instanceof PasswordCallback) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PasswordCallback pc = (PasswordCallback)callbacks[i];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pc.setPassword(password.toCharArray());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
}
</code>
</pre><p>The authenticate( ) method uses the class 
java.security.auth.login.LoginContext to perform the login. The login( )
 method of this class will throw a LoginException if the login fails for
 any reason. This exception is caught by authenticate( ) and it responds
 by setting result to false. false. If no exception is thrown, result is
 set to true. authenticate( ) ends by returning the value of result.</p><p>The
 two arguments to the LoginContext constructor are the most important 
part of this example. The first, the literal string "FileLogin", refers 
to an implementation of the javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule 
interface. This interface is implemented by a provider of a particular 
implementation of authentication technology, for example JNDI, LDAP, or 
database. In this example, we use a free software implementation called 
"tagish" that provides a simple file based authentication scheme. The 
implementation comes from John Gardner and can be found at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://free.tagish.net/jaas/" rel="nofollow">http://free.tagish.net/<strong style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff;">jaas</strong>/</a>.
 Providing a LoginModule implementation is beyond the scope of this 
chapter, but we must illustrate how to use one, once it has been 
provided. This is the beauty of JAAS, the authentication technology 
itself is separated from the rest of the system. In other words, if you 
want to plug in LDAP, do it by providing a custom LoginModule.</p><p>The JVM is made aware of the existence of a LoginModule implementation either through a -D flag, or via a modification to the <code>JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/java.security</code> file. In our case, we use the former option: <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config== D:/Projects/example/chapterCode/ch14/example/src/resources/tagish.login</code>Note
 the use of forward slashes instead of the standard Windows backslashes.
 Also note the "==" instead of just one "=". The format of this file is 
prescribed by JAAS:</p><pre><code>FileLogin
{
&nbsp; com.tagish.auth.FileLogin required
pwdFile="D:/Projects/example/chapterCode/ch14/example/src/resources/passwd";
};
</code>
</pre><p>The FileLogin identifier must match the argument to the 
LoginContext constructor. The first element inside the FileLogin 
declaration is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing 
LoginModule. In our application, we have bundled tagish.jar, which 
contains this class, into the WEB-INF/lib directory of the application. 
The required flag tells the system that the login must succeed, and 
whether it succeeds or fails, the login must still proceed down the 
LoginModule chain. Other valid values for this flag are requisite, 
sufficient, and optional and are described in the javadocs for the class
 javax.security.auth.login.Configuration. The pwdFile argument is an 
implementation specific parameter to the code in tagish.jar that tells 
it where to find its password file. The format of this file is also 
implementation specific and for the example app looks like this:</p><pre><code>username:MD5 Hash Of Password:group*
The specific file for the example follows:
# Passwords for com.tagish.auth.FileLogin

jfitness:5a64edabc9358c603103053a3c600a88:user
stiger:40be4e59b9a2a2b5dffb918c0e86b3d7:user
guest:084e0343a0486ff05530df6c705c8bb4:user
jake:1200cf8ad328a60559cf5e7c5f46ee6d:user:manager
</code>
</pre><p><span>Obviously, a simple MD5 hash of the password is not at 
all secure and a production quality implementation would use an actual 
encryption algorithm. For the purposes of security, MD5 is just as 
secure as Base64 encoding, described earlier in the chapter, which is to
 say, not at all secure. A handy MD5 hash calculator can be found at </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://bfl.rctek.com/tools/?tool=hasher" rel="nofollow">http://bfl.rctek.com/tools/?tool=hasher</a><span>.
 Note that user jake is a member of the user and manager groups, while 
all the other users are simply members of the user group. Groups will 
come into play in the next section.</span></p><p>The second argument to 
the LoginContext constructor is an implementation of the 
javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler interface. The 
LoginCallback implementation saves the username and password ultimately 
originating from the userid and password components in its constructor 
and uses standard boilerplate code to propagate them to the JAAS system.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
