<div class="jive-rendered-content"><span>In
 case you need it, here's a jumpstart on using java.net for your JSR. 1.
 get a java.net id (duh) 2. Create a project called something like 
NAME-spec-public in the </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jsr.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">JSR community</a><span>.
 We try to keep all the java.net projects that correspond to JSRs in 
that project. For NAME, I recommend jsf-metadata. The -spec-public part 
is a practice we've been following thus far. Use this project's issue 
tracker as your main issue tracker. 3. Once your project is approved, 
create a private sub-project, called NAME-spec-eg This will hold the CVS
 repository and any other artifacts you don't want to share with the 
general public, as per JCP guidelines. We generally don't use the issue 
tracker on the private sub-project. 4. I recommend against using the 
java.net mailing lists for EG correspondence. Their search engine is 
sucky compared to the one you get by using the jcp.org mailing list. 5. 
Make all your EG members get java.net ids, and add them as members to 
NAME-spec-eg. Generally, I hate attachments so I like to use the 
documents and files section of the NAME-spec-eg project as much as 
possible, sending URLs around instead. </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
