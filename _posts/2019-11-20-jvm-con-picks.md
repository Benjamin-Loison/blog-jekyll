I am very blessed to have the opportunity to give keynotes at the two
premiere Java conferences in Germany this year,
[JavaLand](https://www.javaland.eu/de/home/news/details/?tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=1898&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&cHash=50964b6ba343f83b9eb803af1df039b5)
and [JVM-CON](https://www.jvm-con.de/speakers/#/speaker/6825-ed-burns).
Of course another amazing blessing is that the former was as an Oracle
employee and the latter as Microsoft, but both of them are about Java.

After reviewing the program, here are my picks.

### Monday 25 November 2019

Workshop Day

#### 09:00 - 13:00 | Ballsall B | Altanwendungen wieder testbar machen [Daniel Kr&auml;er](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/altanwendungen-wieder-testbar-machen)

As a contributor to old apps, and the testing thereof, I am happy to see
a talk about how to continue to test them.  I wonder if the Cactus tests
I wrote for JSF in 2004 will still work?

#### 14:00 - 18:00 | Ballsall A | JEE-Microservices mit Quarkus eine Einführung [Dirk Weil](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/jee-microservices-mit-quarkus-eine-einfuhrung)

While I would rather see Jakarta EE as the future of Enterprise Java, it
seems Quarkus has a fair amount of buzz, RedHat sponsored or otherwise.
This one is worth a look in.

### Tuesday 26 November 2019

#### 10:30 - 11:30 | Tie | Ballsall A, B | Anatole Tresch, Nicholas Frankel (respectively)

Both are great speakers with wealth of real-world application
knowledge.  Really, you can't go wrong with either in this timeslot.

#### 11:40 - 12:40 | Ballsall A | The need for speed  Data streaming in the Cloud with Kafka [Frank Pientka](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/the-need-for-speed-data-streaming-in-the-cloud-with-kafka)

Kafka is one of those things everyone should know.  Take 60 minutes and
listen to Frank about it.

#### 14:00 - 15:00 | Ballsall B | E-Health und E-Government, aber „sicher” mit Java [Werner Keil](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/n-n)

Werner has been around this block a few times and it is worthwhile
hearing his insights.

#### 15:10 - 16:10 | Ballsall A | Jakarta EE  Past, Present and Future [Christian Kaltepoth](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/jakarta-ee-past-present-and-future)

Christian has stuck with Jakarta EE for a long time, with MVC and
JAX-RS.  I have a stake in seeing Java EE succeed, so I am biased in its
favor.  But I can objectively say that Christian is well qualified to
give this important talk.

#### 16:45 - 17:45 | Ballsall A |  Reacting to the future of application architecture [Grace Jansen](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/reacting-to-the-future-of-application-architecture)

This abstract is very high level, but I am interested in hearing a fresh
take on this high level topic.

#### 17:55 - 19:00 | Ballsall B | GraalVM in practice at the Dutch National Police: running R from Scala in Spring Boot 2 [Nathan Perdijk](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/graalvm-in-practice-at-the-dutch-national-police-running-r-from-scala-in-spring-boot-2)

The Dutch government have long been at the forefront of using enterprise
Java.  Yes really.  I remember when they were using lots of JSF.  Heck,
they maybe still are.  It works well, right?  Anyhow, I see the trend
continues with Graal.  Good for them.  The Cops from the Low Countries
are hip to the high tech.

#### 19:30 - 21:30 | Ballsall B | Nightsession: Ein Tag in der UX-Hölle [Armin Reuter](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/nightsession-tba)

As someone who bears responsibility for some UX Hölle of my own, I want
to see this one.

### Wednesday 27 November 2019

#### 09:00 - 17:00 | Raum Dom I+II | Hands-on cloud-native Java with MicroProfile [Emily Jiang](https://www.jvm-con.de/programm/#/talk/full-day-workshop-hands-on-cloud-native-java-with-microprofile)

I am working on a cloud native Java thing at Microsoft.  If will be good
to get Emily's take.
