<p>Raw nots from Niko K&ouml;bler's talk.</p>

<p>Arrived late due to lunch choice.</p>

<p>API Gateway.  Hides possible multiple service calls.  Kinda like
  ESB.</p>

<p>DynamoDB. Fully managed NoSQL datasource.  Document oriented.  Pay by
  read/write/capacity units and used storage, not by time.</p>

<p>Used with Amazon Alexa.  Programs in Alexa are called "skills".</p>

<p>Amazon Lambda has some competition: AzureFunctions, Google
CloudFunctions, IBM Bluemix with OpenWhisk.  Each offers different
  language bindings.</p>

<p>Introducing the <a href="http://serverless.com">Serverless
    Framework</a>.  Looks pretty clean.</p>

<p>Showed how it looks using the AWS web UI.  Then went into postman and
  showed how to interact with the API.</p>

<p>I liked how there is no Docker in this whole thing.</p>
