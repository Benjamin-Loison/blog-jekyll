<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>As mentioned in an <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2006/01/glassfish_jsf_1_1.html" rel="nofollow">earlier blog</a>,
 Glassfish has successfully run Oracle's ADF Faces components. If you 
look in the comments, though, there were some bugs that prevent it from 
running in the latest Glassfish, but happily these have now been fixed. I
 have verified that this has been successfully fixed in today's nightly 
glassfish build, after overlaying the latest JSF nightly on top of it. 
The rest of this blog will cover how to perform an overlay of a JSF 
nightly build on top of a glassfish binary or source build. This is 
necessary until the next JSF integration into Glassfish, which is 
scheduled for today, but won't be available in a promoted build until 
next week.</p><span></span><p>The JSF Team has a new, experimental, 
download offering in its Documents and Files section that will overlay 
the latest JSF nightly onto a given glassfish install directory. Please 
visit <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=1703&amp;expandFolder=1703&amp;folderID=0" rel="nofollow">the nightly build section</a> of the JSF Documents and Files project and download the <code>jsf-glassfish-updater.jar</code>. This file contains the latest JSF nightly and can be executed as follows to install it into glassfish.</p><span></span><pre>java -jar jsf-glassfish-updater.jar &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_GLASSFISH_INSTALL_DIRECTORY&gt;
</pre><span></span><p>Where <code>PATH_TO_YOUR_GLASSFISH_INSTALL_DIRECTORY</code> is the parent of the <code>lib</code>, <code>bin</code>,<code>domains</code> (and so on) directories.</p><span></span><p>The
 jsf-glassfish-updater.jar file will be updated nightly with the latest 
JSF nightly build, and is a great way to get the latest JSF in cases 
where there is no available Glassfish build with the bug-fix you need, 
or you just don't want to download a whole new Glassfish.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
