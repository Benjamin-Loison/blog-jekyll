<p>I'm proud to say I've been at
every <a href="http://www.javaland.eu/">JavaLand</a> since it's
inception in 2014, and blessed to say I'm attending again this year.  My
good friend <a href="http://source-knights.com">Oliver Szymanski</a> and
I are teaching at the
<a href="http://www.javaland.eu/de/programm/schulungstag/">Schulungstag.</a>
The title of our class is: &#8220;Full Stack Java Microservices with
Marathon, Docker and HTML&#8221;, but before our class there is a jam
packed conference schedule to absorb.  Here are my session picks.  Note
that most of day 2 is in one room, Quantum 3+4.  Knowing the short
session duration and the difficulty of getting from one room to another,
this is probably a good conference tip: stay put in one room if you
can.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 28 March</h3>

<ul>

<li> <p>08:30 Quantum 1+2 <a
href="https://www.javaland.eu/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=522447&locS=0&vid=529312">CDI
2.0 is Upon Us</a></p>

<p>Unique this year, there is a full lineup of sessions *even before*
Fried's famous
<a
href="https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/developer_artikel_2160223.html">conference greeting</a>!  What could possibly be worth getting up for at this
hour?  CDI 2.0 of course!  Since its introduction in Java EE 6, CDI has
been at the heart of Java EE, and it is one of the key pieces of Java
EE 8.  The session by spec lead Antoine Sabot-Durand will lay out what's
new and notable.</p>

      <p>This session, in German, lays out the highlights of the
      conference and gets you in the mood.</p>

          <p>This keynote promises from the Chief Digital Office of the
          REWE group will give a peek into the operation of this 50
          billion EUR annual revenue retail giant.  Unless you work
          inside of such an operation, it is rare to get such insight.</p>

      <p>I'll be participating in this panel discussion in my role as

      Java EE 8: Servlet and JSF.</p>

          8 Lambdas: Cool Code that Doesn't Use Streams</a></p>
          
          <p>Simon is a seasoned speaker how knows how to get his point
          across quickly and clearly, something the 40 minute sessions
          of JavaLand require.  I like this topic since so much of the
          Lambda content out there also forces you to contend with the
          equally complex, and powerful stream API.  It will be nice to
          hear one without the other.</p>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/dasniko">Das Niko</a> has a long
        history of being on the cutting edge.  He was all over the
        promising Project Avatar, for example.  I've been a fan of the
        concept of &#8220;serverless&#8221; but have not yet invested
        time in gaining any depth of understanding aside from my simple
        observation that the technology itself seems to be the logical
        end of the road we started to walk with the beginning of
        inversion of control.  Let's see how Niko makes me smart.</p>

        & Efficient Microservices w/ binary protocol - gRPC 101</a></p>
        
        <p>I've been a fan of <a
        href="https://twitter.com/saturnism">Ray Tsang's</a> easygoing,
        yet deceptively information packed style since I attended his <a
        href="https://twitter.com/edburns/status/834913415500038144">Docker
        Tips and Tricks</a> session at <a href="/blog{% post_url 2017-02-21-devnexus-2017-picks %}">DevNexus</a> last week.
        He's great at live coding.  gRPC is a compelling alternative to
        REST, and those of us old enough to remember CORBA will
        appreciate this technology that promises the performance of a
        binary protocol with the simplicity of REST.</p>

          Application - Who the heck needs a Server?</a></p>
          
          <p>I want more, not less, of serverless.  This one looks like
          it is higher level than Niko's.  Plus, I haven't seen anyone
          aside from Mike Keith talk about Backend as a Service.</p>

         <p>I am confident that David's session will replace the
         question mark with an exclamation point, as he share's Oracle's
         vision for the future of Java EE.</p>

          <p>I met Mr. Mechanical Sympathy at <a href="/blog{% post_url 2015-06-16-geekout-2015-summary %}">GeekOut 2015</a> and was
taken by his in-depth "war stories" approach to presenting.  Martin is
unquestionably a world leader in high performance systems, don't miss
this one.</p>

      href="https://www.javaland.eu/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=522447&locS=0&vid=529430">Migrating
      to Java 9 Modules</a></p>
      
      <p>Modules are to Java 9 what Lambdas are to Java 8: the biggest
      feature.  In fact, in my opinion since they are far more
      fundamental and long awaited.  This talk looks like a great way to
      get ready for the most potentially disruptive feature to hit Java
      since annotations in J2SE 1.5.</p>

      Notes of a Command Line Ninja</a></p>
      
      <p>I've done enough pair programming over the years to know that
      command line ninja skills are not a given, but I wish they were.
      Now, I'm no ninja, but I do ok, and I certainly know the value in
      investing even a little time in being more productive in this
      foundational skill.  Besides, many of the <a
      href="/">Rockstars</a> I interviewed listed "tools mastery" as one
      of the most important skills.</p>

            <p>From the abstract, this looks like a good introduction to the hows and whys of microservices. </p>

          <p>Trying to do something useful on this ambitious topic in 40
          minutes is worth a look.  This talk also looks interesting
          because it has a real-world basis.</p>

          <p>I like how MicroProfile is referred to as a
          "pre-specification effort".  As a fan of JCP, I hope that
          proves to be true.  Let's see what they have been up to.</p>

          <p>Any talk that points out the obvious synergy between Java
          EE and microservices, rather than decrying their
            irreconcilability, is worth a look in.</p>

            <p>It will be interesting to see how these two memes come together.</p>

          <p>LightBend, formerly TypeSafe, were the early movers in the
          latest resurgence of the idea of microservices.  As authors of
          the famous <a href="http://reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive
          Manifesto</a>, they had a jump on the rest of the herd.  I've
          been hearing about Lagom for a while, but this is my first
          opportunity to attend a session about it.  Interestingly, the
          presenter appears not to be a LightBend employee, which may
          speak well to the prospects for the objectivity of the
          session.</p>
