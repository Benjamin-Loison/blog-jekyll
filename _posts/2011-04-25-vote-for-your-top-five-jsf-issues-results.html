    <p>Two Thursdays ago, I called for the community to vote for their 
top five issues, you responded with 186 votes, the results of which are 
captured in <a href="http://java.net/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?requestId=10523">JIRA filter JSF_2_2_VOTED_ISSUES</a> and in the following chart. </p>  <p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86648339/ridingthecrest/blog/images/20110425_JSF_2_2_VOTED_ISSUES.png" alt="Bar chart of issues and the number of votes for each"></p>  <p>You
 can see that JSF+CDI and multi-component validtion are the two big 
winners, followed by resource handler improvements and a feature that 
seems like taking the composite components to the next level: support 
for composite applications.</p>  <p>As spec lead, I am now preparing a 
proposal for a work plan to attack these issues in the time we have 
alotted for JSF 2.2 development.  This plan will be shared with the EG 
  and will be the subject of our next EG meeting.</p>    <p><span class="technoratitag">  Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="tag">edburns</a></span></p>
