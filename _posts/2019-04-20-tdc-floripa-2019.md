I am blessed to have the opportunity to speak for the [fourth
time](http://purl.oclc.org/NET/edburns/speaking-engagements/) at the
GlobalCode Developer's conference.  My last time there was in November
2009!  I can't believe it's been that long.  It was a huge event then,
and it's even bigger now.  It's the largest software developer
conference, by number of attendees, in Brazil, and that's saying a lot.
There are at [least **49**
tracks](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2019/florianopolis/trilhas)
over **five days**.

Here are some links to my two talks.

* 14:10 South Center Career Track [Career Tips from Someone Who Knows a Lot of Rockstar Programmers](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2019/florianopolis/trilha-carreiras-e-mentoria)
