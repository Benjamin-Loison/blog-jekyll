In my [previous]({{ site.url }}/blog/2021/05/19/build-picks.html) "session picks" post I lamented "Ever since the end of in-person events, I have not bothered to do my traditional session picks posts".  Well, with [JavaLand 2022](https://javaland.eu) fast approaching, the time has come to resume the practice.

All times in local timezone in JavaLand.

#### 17:00 - 19:00 Dambali (Matamba) Pattern matching mit Java

The day before JavaLand is usually reserved for JavaLand kids activities, but with Coronavirus I have not heard about any such activity.  What I do see on the schedule is one talk from German Java Conference veteran [Falk Sippach](https://twitter.com/sippsack) and newcomer [Merlin B&ouml;gershausen](https://twitter.com/MBoegie) about pattern matching in Java.  Nope, it's not regular expressions they're talking about.  They are talking about language level features such as pattern matching in switch statements, records, and arrays, as described in this authoritative blog post from [Andrew Binstock](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-project-amber-lambda-loom-panama-valhalla).  The talk is in German, but well worth a look.  It's also the only scheduled talk on Monday.

#### 08:30 - 09:10 Schauspielhaus Unittesting für Jakarta EE - das vernachlässigte Wesen

After many years of working mainly with the arrangement of boxes on architecture diagrams, and the JSON it takes to connect those boxes, I look forward to looking deep inside a single box at the humble Unit Test. Join [Gunnar Hilling](https://github.com/guhilling/) for this Jakarta EE focused look at this neglected discipline.

#### 09:30 - 10:30 - Silverado - Begrüßung

I've been to every JavaLand ever, and I can attest that Fried's energetic greetings are not to be missed. I am sure it will be especially emotional after we've all been through two years of pandemic hardship. If you are interested in my take on being thankful to be at a conference after two years of pandemic hardship, check out [this previous post]({{ site.url }}/blog/2021/11/22/workshoptage-keynote-summary-document.html).

#### 09:30 - 10:30 - Silverado - Common Misunderstandings in Software Architecture

I am unfamiliar with [Dr. Carola Lilienthal](https://twitter.com/Cairolali), but her book "Sustainable Software Architecture" looks excellent. This talk is likely a distillation of the lessons in the book.
