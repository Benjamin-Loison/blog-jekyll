My local Java User's Group is getting off to a great start in 2019.  As
was mentioned on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/mgrygles/status/1088190088100700185), we
had [Chicago JUG](https://twitter.com/cjug)'s own
[Mary Grygleski](https://twitter.com/mgrygles) in January, I'll be
speaking in February, and shortly thereafter we'll have my colleage
Santiago Pericas-Geertsen in March.

My talk is chance to see what I'll be presenting as a keynote at
[JavaLand](https://javaland.eu) this year.  You can read more about it
at the following places:

* [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoJUG/events/258490920/)

* [CodeTown](https://codetown.com/events/orlandojug-programming-platform-growth-table-stakes-or-deal-makes)

But briefly, my talk draws from my 25 years of professional programming
experience, spanning many languages, operating systems, and platforms,
to survey what it takes to make a programming language platform
successful in terms of widespread use. I'll look at Java, Python,
Node, Go, and Swift and evaluate the ingredients that brought each one
its own form of success. Finally, I'll draw some lessons that apply
to anyone trying to grow their computing platform, because, at some
level, we are all in the platform business.

> Wednesday 27 February 2019

> 6pm - 8pm

> Starter Studio Orlando

> [101 South Garland Avenue Suite 108, Orlando, FL](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=28.540941%2C-81.381256)

I'll have some copies of

## Coming on March 7th: Project Helidon

My colleague, and former JAX-RS spec lead, Santiago Pericas-Geertsen
will be presenting the new and exciting
[Oracle Project Helidon](https://helidon.io/#/).  Helidon is a
Microprofile friendly Java powered collection of cohesive libraries for
writing software for the microservices style.  You may also know
Santiago as the man behind the innovative
[Oracle Project Avatar](https://www.n-k.de/2014/05/project-avatar-twitterwall-demo.html).

Santiago's talk will be at the same place as my 27 February talk.
