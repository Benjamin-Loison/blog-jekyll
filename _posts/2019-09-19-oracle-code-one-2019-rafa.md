## Framework optimizations

* Moved as much as possible to the build phase

* Allows you to build a native binary

## Into live coding portion

* Gave a great tour of the important features

I found this one a little bit hard to follow.  Could be I was tired, but
I found it hard to remain focused on it.

* [Panache](https://developers.redhat.com/courses/quarkus/panache/)
  brings Hibernate (**not** JPA) to Quarkus, 
  
* Has built in support for Swagger/OpenAPI.
