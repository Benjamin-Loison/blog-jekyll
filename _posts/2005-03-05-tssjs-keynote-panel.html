Q: Motorola guy: Why should I believe that J2EE will withstand the .NET
onslought?

A.Cliff: IBM

A.Mark: people may not want vendor lock-in.&nbsp; People aren't putting all
their IP into .NET.&nbsp; 

A.Rod: projects are succeeding

A.Cliff: Band together to fight MS.&nbsp; JCP.&nbsp; Open Source influencing JCP.

A.Gregor Hohpe: JCP: give us your idea, Sun owns it.&nbsp; MS: give us your
idea, we hire you.&nbsp; It's about developer mindshare.&nbsp; The stuff that is
most pervasive, is the stuff that's no-one talks about any more.&nbsp; Cobol,
C++. There aren't that many Cobol conferences, but many businesses are
running their businesses on it.&nbsp; People like choices, but not too mant
choices.&nbsp; 

A.Linda: agree.&nbsp; We have a competitive technology market of our own,
therefore, we have the benefit of having these technologies compete
against each other.&nbsp; 

A.Mark: No one does COM any more?

A.Gregor: doch.&nbsp; But new development is outweighed by maintenance many
times over.&nbsp; There is lots of COM out there.&nbsp; MS did lose some of the VB
community with ASP.NET.&nbsp; 

Floyd: MS has sent out invitations to developers that are neutral to
hostile to .NET.&nbsp; 

Rod: there is some growth in .NET open source things.&nbsp; How long will EJB
and J2EE live?

A.Dion: waiting for the next thing.&nbsp; 

A.Mark: Look at core of Java and MS.&nbsp; Java: boundaires: JVM, libraries.
Enables independent evolution.&nbsp; .NET: boundary is Windows.&nbsp; Can't evolve
independently.&nbsp; Personal: but can't MS just introduce this boundary?

A.Rod: MS community is very pragmatic.&nbsp; Let's learn from it.&nbsp; 

Audience: I like SOA.&nbsp; Why are you guys dissing it?

A.Gregor: It's coming, but it's not displacing.

A.Rod: SOA is coming, but slowly than it seems.&nbsp; J2EE App Server is
becoming a commodity.&nbsp; 

Q: Does it make sense to bring in loosly typed objects directly into
Java?&nbsp; 

A.Mark: JAXB is going to this.&nbsp; 

A.Cliff: Apache XMLBeans is out there.

A.Dion: EcmaScript for XML, E4X, has this.&nbsp; 

Q.Rod: What's happening with Groovy?

A.Dion: It's a JSR, it shouldn't be.&nbsp; What else can we do on the JVM.

A.Cliff: Open source is a better venue for early collaboration than JCP,
because the vendor nature of JCP.

Q: J12004: we're going after MS developers.&nbsp; It hasn't happened.&nbsp; Why?

A.Gregor: Java makes people waste too much time on versionitis.

A.Mark: He thinks the component area with JSF is where we can make some
headway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

A.Rod: Tools are still not as good as MS.

Q.Nike: missing in java: the nightly batch run.&nbsp; Not a lot of support
for transactionality from a batch process.&nbsp; 

A.Rod: Agree.&nbsp; We're not giving any attention.

A.Mark: Agree.&nbsp; Platform is oriented to interactive "real time" apps,
not batch apps.&nbsp; 

Q. Putting JSF into J2EE seems to be a marketing thing.&nbsp; Will this have
a negative framework for other frameworks?

A.Cliff: Still the same.&nbsp; People will choose, even if it's in J2EE.&nbsp; 

A.Rod: Persistence: there is some clarity in the winner.&nbsp; In the web
space, not yet.&nbsp; It'll be interesting to see who wins.&nbsp; 

A.Mark: I don't think that bundling JSF won't stop other frameworks from
existing out there.

A.Dion: Depends on the kind of app you're building.&nbsp;
