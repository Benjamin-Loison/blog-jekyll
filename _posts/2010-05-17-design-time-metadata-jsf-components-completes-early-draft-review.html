<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>JSR-276
 is targeted at IDE vendors and the JSF component library vendors who 
depend on them for exposing their components to developers. The idea of 
JSR-276 is to let JSF component library vendors provide a far richer set
 of descriptive data about their components so that JSR-276 compliant 
tools can expose that data to the users. Examples of such data include:</p><span></span><ul><li><p>What kinds of components are allowed to be nested within each component?</p></li><li><p>The grouping of components into categories such as, "layout managers"</p></li><li><p>A
 very rich "contract declaration" mechanism that allows component 
libraries to declare contracts and to further more declare which 
components adhere to those contracts.</p></li></ul><span></span><p>There are many more exciting metadata elements in JSR-276. Check itb out yourself at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=276" rel="nofollow">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=276</a>&gt;.
 If lots of people show interest in this, we'll have a better chance of 
IDE's supporting it. Once the spec goes final, let's make a point to add
 issuetracker issues in the major IDEs to support it.</p><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
