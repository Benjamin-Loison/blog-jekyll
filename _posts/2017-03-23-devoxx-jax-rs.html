<p>Raw notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/spericas">Santiago Pericas-Geertsen's</a> JAX-RS 2.1 Reloaded</p>

<p>Quick update on this latest "minor revision".</p>

<p>Reactive Extensions.  Fits really well with JAX-RS API.</p>

<p>Server-Sent Events</p>

<p>Non-Blocking IO</p>

<h2>Reactive Extensions</h2>

<p>Asynchronous Processing in 2.0</p>

<p>Server Side <code>@Suspended</code>
  and <code>AsyncResponse</code>. Resume execution on a different thread.</p>

<p>Client side <code>Future&lt;T&gt;</code>.
  And <code>InvocationCallback</code></p>

<p>Use of <code>async</code> in the midst of builders allows the delay
  of the invocation.  Future doesn't allow you to know when it is safe
  to call <code>get</code>.</p>

<p><code>InvocationCallback</code> allows you to pass in the thing to
call when it effectively is safe to call get.  But this doesn't easily
allow composition: where the value for step 1 needs to be taken into
  account in step 2, for example.  "pyramid of doom".</p>

<p>Some more use cases: composition, combining values, consume values of
  asyncronous tasks.</p>

<p>Now we can use <code>CompletionStage&lt;&gt;</code>.  This fit really
well bscause we didn't have to invent a new type, as we did
  with <code>InvocationCallback</code>.</p>

<p>Turns out that you might want to use RxJava, or some other Rx
  thing.</p>

<p>Two step process.  1. register a provider, 2. Override the default
Invoker.</p>

<p>The ability to do this is an extension for JAX-RS.  Impls are not
  required.</p>

<h2>Server-Sent Events</h2>

<p>Wanted to add in JAX-RS 2, now getting to it in 2.1.</p>

<p>Reviewed the basics of SSE.  Now maintained by WHATWG.</p>

<p>Client API: get an <code>SseEventSource</code> target.  Subscribe to
it, passing in the handler.  Open the event source.  It
  is <code>AutoClosable</code>, so you can use try with resources.</p>

<p>Server API: <code>SseEventSink</code> and <code>Sse</code>.  These
can be passed to resource methods as <code>@Context</code> annotated
arguments.  <code>SseBroadcaster</code> and <code>@Singleton</code>
annotation.  The former is created by your application, not the runtime.
You can use it to connect clients to the sse pipe, and also use it to
  broadcast events when you have them.</p>

<h2>Non-Blocking IO</h2>

<p>Motivation: enable higher throughput and more control over IO.</p>

<h2>NIO Server</h2>

<p>The existing <code>StreamingOutput</code> was still blocking.</p>

<p>Showed some iterations of NIO proposals.  They suffered from
operating at the level of byte streams, also it was hard to integrate
  with the JAX-RS pipeline.</p>

<p>Current proposal: Java 9 Flows.  We want to use it.  So we are
creating copies of the required APIs.  You don't have to use bytes.  You
  can use objects.  You can integrate with third party libraries.</p>

<p>Pattern: Publisher, Subscriber, Processor.  How does this relate to
  JAX-RS?</p>

<p>Why and how to NIO?  It's more complicated code.  But it's useful for
large payloads, which often involve collections.  A collection of Pojos
  is a <code>Publisher&lt;Pojo&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Added a
new <code>MessageBodyReader</code>: <code>NioBodyReader</code>.  Same
  for writer.</p>

<p>What about Filters and Interceptors?  Still being discussed, but he
  did commit to having the feature in there.</p>

<h3>NIO Clients</h3>

<p>Need a new <code>Invoker</code>.  Add <code>nio()</code> method you
  can throw in the builder chain, and then use the normal Flow API.</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<p>Publisher = Source, Subscriber = Sink.  This lends itself to SSE.
  You can think of SSE as a special case of NIO.  An SSE connection is
  just a Flow of SSE Events.</p>
