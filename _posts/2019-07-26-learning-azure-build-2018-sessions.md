I am ardently learning how to be productive on the inside of Azure and
this involves reading docs.  My current focus is the Azure Marketplace,
and I observed that several of the docs pages, [such as this one about
the "solution template" Azure Marketplace offer
type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/azure-applications/cpp-azure-app-offer)
included videos from Microsoft Build 2018.  This prompted me to wonder,
"what other useful Azure related talks happened at Build 2018?"  So, I
went over to [the YouTube channel of all the Build 2018
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHg7uB3_amVXvaRgxIcXLtYD)
and scraped this list, which I've sorted into categories in decreasing
order of relevance to my work.
