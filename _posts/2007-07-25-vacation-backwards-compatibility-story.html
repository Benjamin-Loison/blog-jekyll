<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Back in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.uiuc.edu/" rel="nofollow">college</a> I spent many hours of my copious Freshman year free time playing <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHX_Attack_Chopper" rel="nofollow">LHX</a> on <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://share-it.gatech.edu/author/will" rel="nofollow">Will Day's</a>
 PC. At the time, all I had was an Apple //c, which was already behind 
the times by then. As you can read in the Wikipedia entry, this was a 
flight simulation game. The thing I remember most was the "missle-cam" 
view, where you could fire a TOW missle and then switch to the missle's 
eye view, where you controlled the missle until it hit the target. Well,
 during my recent vacation, I decided to see if I could find a way to 
play it on a current computer. Sure enough, the thing still runs 
unmodified. No emulator or anything.</p><span></span><p>As we're starting up <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314" rel="nofollow">JSF 2.0</a> I'll keep this runtime backwards compatibility firmly in mind as I corral debate and discussion on new features.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
