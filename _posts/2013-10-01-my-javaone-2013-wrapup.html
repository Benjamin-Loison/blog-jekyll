<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>My JavaOne 2013: Wrapup</p><span></span><p>This
 blog entry summarizes my session participation at JavaOne 2013. I plan 
to update this entry with links to the content on Parleys.com as it 
becomes available.</p><span></span><h2>Sessions I Attended</h2><span></span><p>In
 general, speaking more than listening is a very bad way to live. I find
 this holds true at conferences as well. Here are the sessions I 
attended. I attended eight and presented six, so I guess I'm safe. 
Twitter links to session speakers provided for convenient following.</p><span></span><h3>Monday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7696" rel="nofollow">What's New with Bean Validation and Expression Language in Java EE 7 - BOF7696</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/reza_rahman" rel="nofollow">Reza Rahman</a> - Monday, Sep 23, 4:30 PM - 5:15 PM - Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin I</p><p>This informal session expanded on Kin-Man and I presented earlier in the day, and allowed more time for questions.</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Tuesday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2667" rel="nofollow">Building CDI Extensions - CON2667</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/lightguardjp" rel="nofollow">Jason Porter</a> - Tuesday, Sep 24, 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - Parc 55 - Mission</p><p>Having
 built CDI extensions to enable JSF 2.2 FlowScoped and ViewScoped, I was
 keen to see what I had done wrong. Turns out the code Pete Muir and 
J.J. Snyder gave me, and which I hacked on until it worked, is exactly 
what Mr. Porter ordered. I was glad to share one hard-learned nugget in 
writing CDI 1.1 extensions: Don't forget to publish the <code>@Initializved</code> and<code>@Destroyed</code> CDI events at the appropriate times.</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Wednesday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3431" rel="nofollow">Introduce Java Programming to Kids - CON3431</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/arungupta" rel="nofollow">Arun Gupta</a> and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/javafxgeeks" rel="nofollow">Jim Weaver</a> - Wednesday, Sep 25, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Hilton - Continental Ballroom 6</p><p>My
 ten year old is just getting in to programming, and it's inspiring what
 Arun's ten year old has done in the field of educating about Minecraft 
modding. Personally, I'm still a little uneasy with the legality of it 
because it just doesn't feel right to have to bytecode decompile 
something to hack on it, but Arun assures me someone named "Notch" is ok
 with it. I guess that will have to do.</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3023" rel="nofollow">How to Get More Kids to Code - CON3023</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/momatwork" rel="nofollow">Saskia Vermeer-Ooms</a>,<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/reginatb38" rel="nofollow">Regina ten Bruggencate</a>- Wednesday, Sep 25, 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM - Hilton - Continental Ballroom 6</p><p>Even
 though there was subject matter overlap between this and the previous 
sessions, this session offered different perspectives, most importantly 
the female perspective. I think the Devoxx4Kids idea is great. I hope 
someone in our cash-strapped, time-starved educational community here in
 the U.S. picks it up. I don't have the time!</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=4191" rel="nofollow">The Adventurous Developer's Guide to JVM Languages - CON4191</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/sjmaple" rel="nofollow">Simon Maple</a> - Wednesday, Sep 25, 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - Hilton - Yosemite B/C</p><p>In
 the fashion of such breezy talks, Mr. Maple gave an excellent tour of 
some of the more popular JVM languages. I like such talks for their 
value in reducing <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.corvusintl.com/CACM002-5OI.htm" rel="nofollow">first order ignorance</a>.</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Thursday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2079" rel="nofollow">Designing with Lambda Expressions in Java - CON2079</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s" rel="nofollow">Venkat Subramaniam</a> - Thursday, Sep 26, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM - Hilton - Imperial Ballroom A</p><p>This
 and the next talk were referenced in my talk with Kin-Man on Monday, so
 I felt I ought to see what I was recommending. My recommendation was 
worthwhile, as anyone who's seen Mr. Subramaniam speak can attest. I 
have to read <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Patterns-Techniques-Crafting-Presentations/dp/0321820800" rel="nofollow">Matthew McCullough's presentation patterns</a> book, where I bet there are some tips about how to speak like Venkat.</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2962" rel="nofollow">If You Think You Can Stay Away from Function Programming, You Are Wrong - CON2962</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/mariofusco" rel="nofollow">Mario Fusco</a> - Thursday, Sep 26, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM - Hilton - Continental Ballroom 4</p><p>As
 I mentioned in my blog entry about JavaZone, Mr. Fusco can explain 
functional programming better than anyone I've seen. This talk got 
across the essential role of immutability in functional programming, and
 many other gems.</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2406" rel="nofollow">Java EE 8 and Beyond - CON2406</a></p><p>Panel, moderated by Mike Keith - Thursday, Sep 26, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM - Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin II/III</p><p>This panel disussion included <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/cpurdy" rel="nofollow">Cameron Purdy</a> (Oracle), <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/emmanuelbernard" rel="nofollow">Emmanual Bernard</a>(RedHat), <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/bkmartin" rel="nofollow">Brian Martin</a>(IBM), <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/agoncal" rel="nofollow">Antonio Goncalves</a>(Independent), <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/dblevins" rel="nofollow">David Blevins</a>
 (Tomitribe), and Scott Yara (Pivotal). I was very glad to see a fully 
staffed cross-vendor panel. Most interesting to me was the relatively 
soft tone taken by Scott Yara regarding their ongoing support and 
participation in JCP/JavaEE technologies.</p></li></ul><span></span><h2>Sessions I Presented</h2><span></span><h3>Sunday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p>JavaServer Faces from a New Perspective: JSF 2.2, HTML5, Bean Validation 1.1, EL 3.0, JPA 2.1 - JUN10155</p><p>9/22/13 (Sunday) 9:00 AM - Golden Gate University, 536 Mission Street - Room 5215</p><p>Slides ready: 100%</p><p>Demos ready: 100%</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Monday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3298" rel="nofollow">JSF for Multitenant-Enabled Applications - CON3298</a></p><p>9/23/13 (Monday) 10:00 AM - Parc 55, 55 Cyril Magnin St - Market St</p><p>Slides ready: 50%</p><p>Demos ready: 80%</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3733" rel="nofollow">JSR 341: Expression Language 3.0 - CON3733</a></p><p>9/23/13 (Monday) 11:30 AM - Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin I</p><p>Slides ready: 100%</p><p>Demos ready: 100%</p></li><li><p>Booth Duty</p><p>9/23/13 (Monday) 12:00 - 14:30 Hilton Grand Ballroom, 333 O'Farrell St.</p><p>Slides ready: 100%</p><p>Demos ready: 100%</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Tuesday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3294" rel="nofollow">JSF 2.2 New Features in Context - CON3294</a></p><p>9/24/13 (Tuesday) 8:30 AM - Parc 55 - Mission</p><p>Slides ready: 80%</p><p>Demos ready: 90%</p></li><li><p>Booth Duty</p><p>9/24/13 (Tuesday) 09:30 AM - 12:00 Hilton Grand Ballroom</p><p>Slides ready: 100%</p><p>Demos ready: 100%</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2795" rel="nofollow">Meet the Java EE Specification Leads [BOF2795]</a></p><p>Tuesday, Sep 24, 4:30 PM - 5:15 PM - Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin I</p><p>Slides ready: NA</p><p>Demos ready: NA</p></li></ul><span></span><h3>Wednesday</h3><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7809" rel="nofollow">What's New in Portlet 3.0 and JSF 2.2 - CON7809</a></p><p>9/25/13 (Wednesday) 8:30 AM - Parc 55 - Cyril Magnin II/III</p><p>Slides ready: NA</p><p>Demos ready: NA</p></li></ul></div>
