 a huge fan of IRC, as anyone that knows me knows. Inside Sun, we have a
 large and vital IRC network and the JSF team uses the #jsfaces channel 
to provide telepresence. In the past, I've blogged requesting that </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/07/lets_hear_it_fo_1.html" rel="nofollow">java.net provide an IRC server as part of their offerings</a><span>, and subsequently recommended people </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/07/irc_followup_le.html" rel="nofollow">use JXTA to provide this feature</a><span>.
 This is currently in progress and I still advocate using JXTA. In fact,
 I'm on right now. In the meantime, however, I have discovered that 
there is an irc channel for JSF on irc.freenode.net, ##jsf. I'm going to
 start hanging out there, so you can catch me online if you want.&nbsp; </span><p> <span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span>&nbsp; </p></div>
