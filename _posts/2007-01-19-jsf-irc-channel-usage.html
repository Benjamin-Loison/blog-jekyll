<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Because JavaServer Faces technology is delivered by Sun as a part of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/" rel="nofollow">the Java EE SDK</a>and also <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Glassfish</a>,
 the Sun JSF team strongly feels that community is important. To that 
end, I've been plugging the use of the ##jsf irc channel on 
irc.freenode.net as a community resource. My team and I try to maintain a
 daily presence in the channel. <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/10/jsf_irc_channel_1.html" rel="nofollow">Since we started hanging out there</a>, we've seen the daily traffic steadily grow.</p><span></span><p>Now
 that over a year has passed, I thought it would be fun to throw in a 
graph. Here is a chart of the daily log size for the ##jsf channel, 
where each data point is a weekly average of the size, in bytes, of the 
daily log file. The first datapoint in the x axis is from the fourth 
week of 2006, on up to today.</p><span></span><p>If you want to join the channel, please <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/#IRC" rel="nofollow">see the instructions at the JSF main site</a>.</p><span></span><p><img alt="graph.jpg" class="jive-external-image" width="1048" height="760"></p><span></span><p>Many thanks to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.rifers.org/" rel="nofollow">Geert Bevin</a>who, very graciously and professionally provides the log bot on the channel.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
