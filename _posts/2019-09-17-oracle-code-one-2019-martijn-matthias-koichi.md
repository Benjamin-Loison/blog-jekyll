## Interesting aspects of the discission

* English vs. Local language in code.  For example if your time is all
  fluent in Kanji, it might be great to just write the actual code in
  Kanji.  However, if you want to consider diversity and inclusion,
  doing so may be a barrier to entry.
  
* Open Source while being employed, you need to consider who owns the
  code?  Your employment contract is the authority on this matter.
  
# Build Community

* Mattias told the origin myth of Jfokus: started as a JUG, then became
  a juggernaut of Nordic conferences.
  
* Koichi talked about the KanJava JUG.

Battery running out!
