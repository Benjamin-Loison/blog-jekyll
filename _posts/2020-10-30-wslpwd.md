I had long been used to doing `open .` on macOS to get finder window
open on the current directory in the shell.  I wanted something similar
under WSL2, but this is the best I could come up with.  It copies the
current working directory to the clipboard such that you can press
"ctrl-l crtl-v ret" in the File Explorer and get the same effect.

```bash
function wslpwd() {
  echo //wsl$/Ubuntu$PWD | sed 's:/:\\:g' | pbcopy
}
```

Assumptions

* pbcopy is installed
* WSL distro name is Ubuntu

It prepends the special `//wsl$/Ubuntu` string to the `$PWD`, then uses `sed`
to transform the forward slashes to backslashes, then uses `pbcopy` to put
the result on the system clipboard.
