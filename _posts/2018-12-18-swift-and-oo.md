One thing I noticed learning Swift is how it's approach to object
orientation differs from the classical approach I was taught in college,
back when OO was the dominant way of designing software.  This post 

I can't find any academic papers about "protocol oriented programming".
How does it differ from "design by contract"?

I searched the ACM Digital Library for "Protocol Oriented Programming".
None of the top 50 hits were about the actual thing that Apple's Swift
developers are talking about.
