 is using JSF for at least some of their revenue generating apps. 
Apparently ATG uses ADP for their payroll processing. Anyhow, I thought 
that was great and when someone (Doug) asked me about commercial JSF 
deployments at the smackdown today, I mentioned that ADP was a big 
commmercial user. It just so happens that one of the people that worked 
on it, Jon Cochran, was in the audience and introduced himself to me 
after the talk. Very cool!</p><span></span><p>Regarding the smackdown in

to Jim Driscoll for recommending him. My main goal for this session was 
to entertain the audience and Kevin really made the session very fun. 
Also thanks to the panelists for being such good sports and playing 
along. I hope it was informative for people. I'd love to hear comments. I
 think it turned out pretty well, everyone defended their turf nicely, 
but I thought JSF came out on top (DING!) Seriously, though it was great
 to share with the audience some insight into the differences between 
the frameworks.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
