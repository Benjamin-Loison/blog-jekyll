<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The most I'd heard of groovy is what <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Dion</a>
 said at the 2005 Server Side Java Symposium. There he said it was a bit
 backwards to have a JSR for a scripting language before it was more 
fully fleshed out. Something about a cart and a horse. Anyway, after 
atttending this talk I can see things seem to be progressing nicely, and
 I don't know if I agree with Dion's assesment, though I can see where 
he's coming from.</p><span></span><p>It's all about less lines of code.</p><span></span><p>Most
 of the web tier is duct tape with pockets of business logic. Good 
point. Scripting languages are built for glueing things together.</p><span></span><p>Why another scripting language?</p><span></span><p>want binary compatability with Java. Want something similar to Java.</p><span></span><pre>features of Ruby Python and Smalltalk.

J/Python, J/Ruby, Beanshell, all lacking.

Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic and optional static typing.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idea: write a component in groovy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Native syntax for lists, maps, arrays, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closures: nested expressions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regex built in ==~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operator overloading, not a good example.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Semicolons are optional.

Groovy JDK, intercepts all calls and delegates to underlying class if
not implemented at the groovy level.&nbsp; Can add new methods dynamically at
runtime.&nbsp; Can use a "use" clause to pull it in.

Working with groovy and Java together.&nbsp; Groovy classes can be called
directly from java.&nbsp; Can also use with ant.&nbsp; &lt;script&gt; tag.&nbsp; or
&lt;groovy&gt; tag.

XML Generation

groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder

There are lots of MarkupBuilders in groovy.&nbsp; This would be easy to build
renderers.

XML Parsing

Extras

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GroovyTest.&nbsp; Easier than JUnit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thicky, Server side Groovy based rich client delivery via JSP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unix scripts in groovy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveX Proxy nice for being able to connect to MS apps that expose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveX APIs, such as XSL.&nbsp; Can be used to drive IE.

Status

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0 in September

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development time, less than half of Java

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance: slow 20 - 90% of java

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready for small non-mission critical, experimental.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate to supplement ant, unit testing
