<p>Raw notes from Linda DeMichiel's Java EE 8 talk.</p>

<p>What was in EE 7: Actually a very action packed release, with the
usual themes: simplicity, platform cohesion, embracing contemporary
  standards.</p>

<p>EE8: Admit the impact of the hiatus.  The original plan had to be
  scaled back from 12 to 9 JSRs.  Really not a big scale back.</p>

<p>Two net new JSRs: Security and JSON-B.  Revisions for Servlet, JSF,
  JSON-P, JAX-RS.</p>


<p>JSON-P.  JSON-Pointer: String syntax for referencing into a JSON
  document.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">RFC-6901</a>.
  Would be nice if there was EL integration.  JSON Patch: Ability to
  mutate a JSON
  document.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC-6902</a>.
  This has a builder API.  JSON-Merge Patch: Conditionally apply the
  patch.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386">RFC-7386</a>.  <strong>Also
  includes seamless integration with Java SE 8 Lambda and
    Strings.</strong></p>

<p>JSON-B.  Like JAX-B, but for JSON.  This is the missing piece for
  JSON in standard Java.  <code>JsonbBuilder</code> is the client entry
  point.  <code>Jsonb</code> the thing you actually manipulate.  Allows
  you to annotate your Java Pojo to control how it is mapped to JSON.
  The <code>JsonBConfig</code> allows you to do this control.  The RI is
  called <a href="http://json-b.net/">Yasson</a>.</p>

<p>JAX-RS.  New features: Reactive Client API, Server Sent Events,
  NIO.  I have more on this at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{%
post_url 2017-02-22-jax-rs-2_1-new-feature-introduction %}">a previous
  post</a>.  Linda's talk had more structure on Server Sent Events.  I
  am glad she emphasized the value JAX-RS brings in sending SSE to both
  client and server when doing REST.</p>

<p>Servlet. But first set the context with some plain content on HTTP/2.
  When talking about the binary framing, she mentioned that frames were
  self describing, which was a nice observation. </p>

<p>JSF. A mature technology.  An enormous number of community requested
  fixes.  She did address why we are continuing JSF while we are not continuing MVC.  This was nice to hear.  </p>

<p>CDI 2.0.  Mostly about how to use CDI in Java SE environments,
  outside of Java SE.  This is hugely important for fat-jar style
  Microservices.  Some enhancements to CDI events.  In 1.1, events are
  invoked synchronously, without regard for priority.  2.0 allows
  prioritization and ordering.  Adds async
  events: <code>event.fireAsync()</code> and <code>@ObserveAsync</code>.</p>

<p>BeanValidation 2.0.  Continuing the theme with JSF, adds support for
  a number of Java SE 8 features.  Adds some new constraints.  Add
  ability to apply constraints on insertion into <code>Map</code>.</p>

<p>Security 1.0.  Three new APIs <code>SecurityContext,
  HttpAuthenticationMechanism, IdentityStore</code>.  The first is under
  debate about whether or note the first is actually
  necessary.  <code>SecurityContext</code> is intended to supercede APIs
  in several of the other EE technologies.  I like the
  idea.  <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code>, modeled on JASPIC,
  and JASPIC is intended to delegate to this.  It is used to
  authenticate callers of web applications.  <code>IdentityStore</code>
  has methods for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>Summary: Target release date of this summer!</p>
