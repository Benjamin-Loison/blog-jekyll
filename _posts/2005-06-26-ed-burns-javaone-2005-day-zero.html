<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Attending Java Licensee Day is one of many benefits of being a full <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/licensees.html" rel="nofollow">Java Licensee</a>.
 Attendees get an advance peak at the Roadmap for Java Technology and 
access to the people helping to create it. My personal role in this last
 point was to participate in the Ask the Experts panel along with Rajiv 
Mordani, Ken Drachnick, Roberto Chinicci, Eduardo Pellegri-Llopart, Bill
 Shannon, Paul Sterk, and one other gentleman whom I didn't know whose 
name escapes me. I guess J2EE licensees aren't a chatty lot so during a 
dry-spell I took the opportunity to ask the assembled licensees, who pay
 some good dough to sport the J2EE brand, "are your customers clamoring 
for a light weight framework, like <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://springframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Spring</a>"?
 Only Barry Coleman of ATG replied, and they said yes, but they feel 
their product entry in this space, which has been around much longer 
than Spring, is better. I was surprised at the lack of response to this 
question, given the buzz in the blogosphere about Spring.</p><span></span><p>At
 the reception, I met with Steve Montal and Sam Heisz of Caucho 
Technologies, maker of Resin. I explained one value add of JCP 
membership to them: the ability to shape the platform and demonstrate 
thought leadership to their customers. It says something to a customer 
when you can point to an important feature in Java and say, "See that 
feature? That's us." Learned they definately plan to implement JSP 2.1, 
but no plans for JSF. By way of persuading them to provide another 
clean-room JSF impl, I told them that if they implemented JSP 2.1, 
they'd have a good part of the battle for JSF 1.2 done. Their main 
concern with the design of JSF is their misunderstanding that you <strong>must</strong>
 use the session for state saving. I corrected this misunderstanding and
 said that they could take the Sun RI (which they're totally legally 
entitled to do as Java EE Licensees) and simply replace the state saving
 impl with their own.</p><span></span><p>Personal notes at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/edburns?entry=ed_burns_javaone_2005_day" rel="nofollow">my sun.com blog</a>.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
