&nbsp; - Agile J2EE has saved the J2EE platform from destroying itself via
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its own best practices (blueprints).

&nbsp; - AOP 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not growing as fast as he expected, but it will continue to grow

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AspectJ 5.0 will be the definitive AOP framework going forward

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standardization?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to see the benefit now

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JCP standardization not appropriate for AOP.&nbsp; AOP is not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language-specific.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proxy-based AOP: a transitional technology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implications of AOP for app servers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - We'll see an evolution from a monolithic container to a service
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integration point.&nbsp; I think he's saying the app server is being
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commoditized.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technologies to watch

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IoC/Dependency injection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TDD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O-R mapping.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post struts 1.x web technology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value add web technologies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Struts 2.0 is moving into workflow

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beehive

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring is adding web flow technology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich Client

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical skills to acquire

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frameworks/methodologies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ability to set and ensure project direction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offshoring: it's coming, if you know to leverage, you'll have a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; job
