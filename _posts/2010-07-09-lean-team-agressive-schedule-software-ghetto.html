<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The original Pragmatic Programmers, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas, talk about the tragedy of the software ghetto in this <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html" rel="nofollow">2003 interview with Bill Venners</a>.
 We all know the story of how unfixed broken windows can cause a nice 
neighborhood to start looking like a ghetto, and how this analogy is 
applied to an enterprise software project. While working through my 
email today, I came across a management pitfall: Agressive Scheduling + 
Lean Team = Software Ghetto. Here's the story.</p><span></span><p>My 
current lean team is dealing with a steady influx of bugs/issues found 
in the source code, while at the same time having to conform to an 
agressive schedule with very clearly defined priorities. If an issue 
doesn't fit within the priorities for the schedule, it's put on the 
bottom of the list.</p><span></span><p>As one of the responsible engineers for Oracle's JSF implementation, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Mojarra</a>,
 I have committed to review and evaluate new issues on the issue tracker
 as quickly as possible after they come in. I try to do this as part of 
my email reading process. Today's issue: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1729" rel="nofollow">1729</a>.
 While using our existing automated test harness to try to reproduce the
 bug, I made an XML authoring error, but it took a while to diagnose 
because I found another bug that was masking the exception. The right 
thing to do would be to file an issue on this other bug and move on. 
However, our current agressive schedule and lean team would dictate that
 this issue would certainly not be addressed this calendar year, and 
would likely never make the cut because such little issues are never 
high priority enough to be judged important when crafting an agressive 
schedule. So, I decided to fix the exception masking issue now. Did I 
make the right choice?</p><span></span><p>According to the management 
school of laser focus, schedule at all costs, probably not. According to
 the school of quality and ghetto avoidance, probably yes. I assert that
 projects that have agressive schedules with clearly defined priorities 
    combined with a lean team to meet that schedule will <strong>tend</strong><strong>to</strong> generate software ghettos. What do you think? Did I make the right choice?</p><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags:<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
