I've been very busy bringing Java EE to Azure since I joined Microsoft this June.  I have devoted a fair chunk of that time to learning Azure fundamentals, [getting to know the broader Java team](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/08/19/microsoft-acquires-jclarity-to-help-optimize-java-workloads-on-azure/), building the team, partnering with Oracle, and working with my Program Manager Reza Rahman to help identify and develop customers interested in Java EE on Azure.  This last point is the subject of this blog post.

### Update WebLogic Server on Azure IaaS

Back in July, I documented the state of WLS on Azure [IaaS](https://aka.ms/NISTSays) in a [blog post](/blog{% post_url 2019-07-07-wls-azure-marketplace %}).  I'm happy to say that we have made great progress since then in partnership with Oracle to update the offer, which you can read more about in Jacob Thomas's post on [the WebLogic Blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/oracle-weblogic-server-on-microsoft-azure-iaas).  Here is a video walk through of the IaaS offer for WLS.
