<div class="jive-rendered-content"><span>Next
 month I'll have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time to John 
Loiacano, Sun's head of Software. I usually can come up with tough 
questions on my own, but since I got into blogging, I thought, "why not 
see what the world wants to know?" So, please leave a comment with your 
questions, if you are so inclined. I can't commit to publishing any 
answers in this forum, but who knows, perhaps I'll run into you at a 
conference and we can talk off the record. In person, I can exercise the
 usual discretion when talking about such things, which isn't as easy in
 a blog. Ed&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
