<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Iâ€™m happy to report that the 2014 edition of the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2801" rel="nofollow">Web Framework Smackdown</a>
 is shaping up to be a good one. This year we have a solid lineup, and 
for the first time we are going beyond Java with the inclusion of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/mhevery" rel="nofollow">Misko Hevery</a> representing AnguarJS and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/floydophone" rel="nofollow">Pete Hunt</a> representing React. Representing a more Java-centric approach to UI we have myself (representing JavaEE and JSF) and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/joonaslehtinen" rel="nofollow">Joonas Lehtinen</a>representing Vaadin. The discussion is sure to be lively, as noted industry gadfly <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/neal4d" rel="nofollow">Neal Ford</a>,
 who recently caused a stir by suggesting organizations rethink their 
use of server side Java UI frameworks. With such a diverse range of 
approaches and such a provocative moderator, the discussion is bound to 
be interesting. The session is now in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2801" rel="nofollow">JavaOne Content Catalog</a>, register now and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/register/" rel="nofollow">save money</a> and lock in your seat at the session.</p></div>
