<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>When working to revive <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient" rel="nofollow">Webclient</a>as
 a means to enable one to write automated tests for Ajax Applications, I
 ended up fixing some thread safety assertions that were failing in 
native code. Part of this involved slightly recrafting the design of the
 native/Java DOM bridge, originally written over seven years ago by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/idk/" rel="nofollow">Igor Kushnirsky</a>. Igor's original design had lots of <code>public native</code>
 methods. My problem was that I needed these methods to have their 
native code executed on a particular thread. However, the DOM methods 
can be called from any old thread in the application. Webclient already 
does this with an internal <code>NativeEventThread</code> class. All 
webclient methods that end up in native code happen on that thread. 
Basically, I had to go through the Java DOM code and turn this:</p><span></span><pre>public native Element getElementById(String elementId);

</pre><span></span><p>into this:</p><span></span><pre>public Element getElementById(String elementId) {
&nbsp; // Make this happen on the NativeEventThread.
&nbsp; return nativeGetElementById(elementId);
}
native Element nativeGetElementById(String elementId);

</pre><span></span><p>Of course, I would have to modify the function names in the native C++ source files as well.</p><span></span><p>In case you were wondering, I did consider these solutions but rejected them.</p><span></span><dl><dt>Use Javier Pedemonte's Java XPCOM bridge</dt><dd>I
 plan to completely rewrite the mozilla layer of webclient and dom to 
use this most excellent software after I get the 2.0 release done. I 
don't have time for that extensive rewrite now.</dd><dt>Use aspect oriented programming techniques</dt><dd>Sure, I could do this, but I don't want to introduce another dependency on another technology.</dd></dl><span></span><p>That
 said, I wrote some xemacs macros as I went along and it only took a 
couple hours of manual editing. While doing it, I re-compiled all along 
the way. Naturally, the compiler caught some things, which I easily 
fixed, as I went along.</p><span></span><p>This got me thinking. Say 
this code was written entirely in a scripting language. If so, this sort
 of "complicated, human-assisted global search and replace" change (I 
won't call it refactoring since this particular process was so specific 
to JNI) would be really error prone and hard to debug. The absence of a 
type checking compiler would really make this sort of change hard.</p><span></span><p>I
 assert that this sort of change is happens all the time in the 
maintenance phase of a large software project. I assert that the person 
making the change is seldom the same person who wrote the code 
originally. Given these assertions, I predict much woe for the 
maintenance programmer who has to do such a change on a scripting 
language based project. I continue to urge caution for those listening 
to scripting zealots when they consider moving more of their projects to
 scripting languages.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
