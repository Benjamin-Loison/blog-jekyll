movie theater with audience looking at rockstar book cover" /> I'm very
pleased to announce the continuation of my "Secrets of the Rockstar
Programmers" project in the form of a podcast.  This latest stage in the
project is delivered using a guest-episode format graciously hosted by
my good friends at <a href="http://www.javaoffheap.com/">The Java
OffHeap Podcast</a>.</p>


<p>The episodes will be a part of an occasional "Mark and Sweep" segment
  where I will join the OffHeap gang to revisit and discuss audio clips
  of his interviews with some of the early 21st century's top enterprise
  programmers.  This occasional guest segment will include interviews
  from my 2008 McGraw-Hill book
  "<a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/">Secrets of the Rock Star
  Programmers</a>" as well as new interviews with contemporary experts.
  The gang and I will reflect on the observations in the interview in
  the contemporary context.
</p>

<p>In the first episode, Freddy and I review the interview with James
Gosling, "Father of Java".  Topics explored include the subversive
origin of Java, the benefit of starting in a new field as it is
maturing, the origin of creativity, and the importance of telling signal
  from noise.</p>
