<p>Raw notes from <a href="http://twitter.com/randyshoup">Randy Shoup</a>.</p>


<p>VP of engineering at Stitch Fix.  Did consulting in a "CTO as a
service", before that was Director of Engineering at Google and chief
  engineer at eBay.</p>

<p>About Stitch Fix.  Reverse of standard retail.  Fill out style
profile, get five handpicked items, keep what you like, return the
  rest.</p>

<p>Behind the model is a lot of Art and Data Science.</p>

<p>1:1 Ratio of engineering and data scientists</p>

<p>Apply intelligence to <b>every</b> part of the business</p>

<p>Buying, inventory management, logistics, styling, demand prediction</p>

<p>What is styling: personalized recommendations based on algorithmic
  recommendations with a human curation layer.</p>

<p>Modern software dev: org, practices, culture, </p>

<p>small teams, devops</p>

<p>Small teams: aligned to domains, cross functional, depend on other
  teams for help as well.</p>

<p>practices: TDD.  Motherhood and apple pie.  Continuous delivery: most
applications deployed multiple times per day.  Release smaller units of
  work, easier to roll back and role forward.  Better for AB testing.</p>

<p>Culture: The amazon model: you build it, you run it.</p>

<h2>Microservices</h2>

<p>Architecture Evolution</p>

<p>eBay: Monolithic Perl, Monolitic C++, Java, Microservices.</p>

<p>Twitter and Amazon had a similar evolution.  It's ok to start out as
  a monolith.</p>

<p>The micro of microservice is: single purpose, simple well defined
interface, isolated persistence (each one keeps its own state).  It's
  SOA done right.</p>

<p>Approach 1: operate your own data store.  Store to your own Postgres, ie.</p>

<p>Approach 2: Use a persistence service and store to your own tables,
  operated as a service on your behalf.  Slice is isolated.</p>

<h3>Maintaining interface stability</h3>

<p>backward/forward compatibility of interfaces.  Can never break your
  client's code.  Semantic versioning.  major.minor.patch</p>

<p>Often maintaining multiple deployments and interface versions.  Need
an explicit deprecation policy.</p>

<p>Went through procress from extracting services from the shared
  DB.</p>

<p>Principle: single system of record.  There can be copies of that.</p>

<p>Approach 2: Async event+local cache.  Customer service sends events.
  Order service listens to events.</p>

<p>Approach 3: Shared metadata library.  Read only metadata, basically
  immutable.</p>

<p>Events as first class construct.  This was from Martin's talk.  Event
  means: statement that something interesting has happened.</p>

<p>Fourth fundamental building block.  Presentation, Application,
  Persistence, Events</p>

<p>Events and Microservices go well together.</p>

<p>Service interface includes: Synchronous request response.  Events the
  service produces/consumes.</p>

<p>Joins: monolithic databases make joins very easily.  How to split it out?</p>

<p>Approach 1: Service that materializes the view.  Service that
materializes the view.  </p>

<p>Approach 2: Join in the client.</p>

<p>Note that mashup style web apps do this.</p>

<h3>Microservice Techniques: Workflows and Sagas</h3>

<p>Problem: Monolithic apps make this trivially easy.  Splitting data
across services is hard.  So, transactions turn into Sagas: Model the
transaction as a series of steps coordinated by events.  It's like a
workflow.  Rolllback by applying compensating operations.  Many common
systems already do this.  For example payment processing and approval
  workflows (expense reports).</p>

<p>Ideal use for functions as a service.  Very lightweight logic,
stateless, triggered by an event.  Healthy companies in the future will
  be doing some or all of this.</p>
