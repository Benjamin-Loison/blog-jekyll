<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>If you read mozilla.dev.tech.plugins (who doesn't?) you may know that
I have been working <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://purl.oclc.org/NET/edburns/plugletStatus/" rel="nofollow">very
intermittantly</a> since March 2006 to revive the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/java-plugins/" rel="nofollow">Pluglet
Project</a>.&nbsp; This project provides a sensible API to allow Firefox
plugins to be written in the Java Programming language.</p>

<p>Working from the Orlando International Airport while waiting for my
delayed flight up to the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://theajaxexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=313" rel="nofollow">Ajax
Experience Conference in Boston, MA</a>, I managed to get the basic
media player working, with sound too.&nbsp; However, the only reason the
stream feature works is that the design of the MediaPlayer pluglet
simply gets the URL of the media file from the OnStartRequest callback,
which it then fetches directly rather than using the stream APIs to get
the data.&nbsp; This is inefficient and not a general purpose solution.&nbsp; The
next step will be to implement the general stream APIs all the way.</p>

<p>Turns out my flight was mightily delayed and I'm stranded overnight in
Atlanta.&nbsp; On the bright side, the Hyatt Place near the airport is quite
nice, has included breakfast and free wireless internet, which enabled
me to check in this snapshot.</p>

<p>More later this week, if time allows.</p>
