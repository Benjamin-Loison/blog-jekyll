I was blessed with the opportunity to take full advantage of the brief
window of COVID-19 pandemic relaxation in early September 2021 and
accepted the opportunity to [deliver the
keynote](https://workshoptage.ch/jubilaeumsfeier) at the 30th
Anniversary of Workshop-Tage in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.  I decided to
follow the advice of this guy, Paul Hughes.  He advises: After a
Keynote Speech: Avoid this Common Mistake: [Do not share
slides](https://paulhugheslive.com/after-a-keynote-speech-avoid-this-common-mistake/).
Mr. Hughes's blog post is targeted at the party hiring the keynote
speaker, but with the keynote speaker themselves as a secondary
target.

Life being what it is, I'm still working on the summary document,
three months later, but have the second draft up at [my
gist](https://gist.github.com/edburns/cc938e58a4d42edcccb2061be071a916).
I intend to post the actual summary document as my next post here.
