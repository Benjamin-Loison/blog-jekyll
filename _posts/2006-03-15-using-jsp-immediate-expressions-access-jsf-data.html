<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Here
 is an ultra-quick blog entry sharing something in JSF 1.2 about which 
I'm not sure many people are aware. Thanks to the unified EL, it is 
possible to refer to JSF managed beans and other JSF concepts using 
plain old JSP expressions in the page. For example, let's say you have a
 JSF app that is a bookstore. In the app is a managed bean that is a Map
 where the keys are ISBN numbers and the values are Book JavaBeans that 
have properties like author, title, ISBN, etc.</p><span></span><p>In JSF
 1.1, to display any information from the book Map, you had to use JSF 
components. In JSF 1.2, you can use plain old JSP ${} expressions to 
access this data, like this:</p><span></span><pre>The title is ${books["0072262400"].title}.&nbsp; 
</pre><span></span><p>Even though <code>books</code> is a managed bean, you can still access it without JSF.</p><span></span><p>Keep
 in mind that you can also access all the implicit objects, including 
JSF ones, in this manner. For example, if you wanted to use EL to get 
the locale of the current view, you could say:</p><span></span><pre>${view.locale}
</pre><span></span><p>As a final example, if you wanted to get the 
remote user name of the current user using standard Servlet 
authentication APIs you could say:</p><span></span><pre>${facesContext.externalContext.remoteUser}
</pre><span></span><p>Basically anything that conforms to JavaBeans naming conventions and is accessible from the <code>FacesContext</code> or<code>UIViewRoot</code> can be reached via the EL in this way.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
