I was recently asked if the [WebLogic on Azure Virtual
Machines](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/java-ee-on-azure-with-weblogic-and-linux-virtual-machines/)
Azure Marketplace Offers were available on [Azure
Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/).  I was
told the best way to discover this was to look at [Azure Marketplace
items available for Azure
Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-marketplace-azure-items?view=azs-1910).
Apparently this page is updated via syndication from Azure Marketplace,
but I don't know exactly how.

To answer the question: as of this writing, no, the offers are not
available in Azure Stack.
