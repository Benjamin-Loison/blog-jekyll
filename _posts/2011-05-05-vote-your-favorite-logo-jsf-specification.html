 (or a similar method) is the last best hope to save representative 
democracy in America, so I decided to use a very nice and simple 
web-based implementation for the poll. Please visit &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://bit.ly/JsfLogoPoll" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/JsfLogoPoll</a>&gt; to vote.
