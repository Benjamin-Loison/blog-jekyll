<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of the Proposed Final Draft revisions of the next release of the JavaServer<sup>TM</sup>Faces and Pages specifications. The Faces spec may be downloaded from &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=252" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=252</a>&gt; and the Pages spec may be downloaded from &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=245" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=245</a>&gt;<i>We really want feedback!</i> <strong>Please use our <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=617376&amp;tstart=0" rel="nofollow">Forum</a> to share your thoughts on the specs</strong>.

 this entry, I link to a comprehensive high level outline of the changes
 to the spec since the 1.1 release of the Faces spec. I've decided 
include changes present in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr252/" rel="nofollow">December Early Draft Release</a>, the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pr/jsr252/" rel="nofollow">April Public Review Release</a> and the current Proposed Final Draft release for completeness. As such, this entry repeats some information from my<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/04/javaserver_face_1.html" rel="nofollow">blog entry on the April Public Review Release</a>.

 expression language used in Faces, which was inspired by the expression
 language used in JSTL and JSP, has been generalized and extracted into 
its own top level <code>javax.el</code> package. The EL is agnostic of 
the technology hosting it, such as JSP or Faces, and is intended to be 
generally useful in the same way one can use OGNL in a variety of 
applications. Faces now has deprecated its internal EL in favor of using
 the Unified EL.</p></li><li><p>New Tree Creation and Content Interweaving Model for Faces applications that use JSP</p><p>While
 it is perfectly acceptable to use Faces without using JSP, many people 
find their productivity increases when using these two technologies 
together. Unfortunately, as amply documented by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/06/09/jsf.html" rel="nofollow">Hans Bergsten in his article at onjava.com</a>,
 there were some integration cases that didn't work as expected. By 
changing the specification of the implementation of the Faces 
ViewHandler for JSP, as well as changing the JSP custom tag base class 
used by all Faces component tags, these problems have all been resolved.</p></li><li><p>Integration with JSTL</p><p>Another long standing problem was in using JSTL's<code>&lt;c:forEach&gt;</code>
 tag to contain Faces input components. Because JSP has no notion of a 
postback, it was not possible to apply the values correctly to the 
nested input components on postback. By introducing some new concepts 
into the EL, it is now possible to fully use <code>&lt;c:forEach&gt;</code>with
 any kind of Faces component. This will require a new release of JSTL, 
which will also be present in J2EE 5, along with Faces and JSP.</p></li><li><p>Back Button issues and Multi Frame or Multi Window Faces Apps</p><p>Due
 to a deficiency in the State Management API using Faces in Multi Frame 
or Multi Window applications presented some problems. The browser back 
button also could cause application state to become confused. These 
problems have now been fixed.</p></li><li><p>Associating a message with a particular component in the page.</p><p>Previous
 revisions of the spec didn't allow for dynamically including the label 
of a component in an error message for that component. New spec features
 now allow for this to happen.</p><p>It is now possible to override the 
conversion or validation message that is displayed to the user on a 
per-instance basis. For example:</p><pre><code>
&lt;h:inputText value="#{bean.value}" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiredMessage="#{bundle.requiredMessage}"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; converterMessage="#{bundle.converterMessage}"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; validatorMessage="#{bundle.requiredMessage}"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;f:validateLongRange maximum="1" minimum="10"/&gt;
&lt;/h:inputText&gt;

</code>
</pre></li><li><p>AJAX support</p><p>As you should all know by know, 
AJAX is mainly a component thing, but there are some things the basic 
JSF framework can do to make things a little easier for those writing 
AJAXian JSF components. Even without these features (ie, in JSF 1.1), <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://bpcatalog.dev.java.net/nonav/ajax/jsf-ajax/frames.html" rel="nofollow">it's very easy to write AJAX components for JSF</a> and easier still to use them.</p><p>Specify that the <code>FacesServlet</code> should look for an<code>init-param</code>
 called javax.faces.LIFECYCLE_ID to identify the Lifecycle to be used 
for processing this request. This approach allows you to map different 
instances of the<code>FacesServlet</code> with different lifecycles. For example, one mapping for standard JSF requests and another for AJAX JSF requests.</p><p>Specify
 the name of the state saving parameter so that AJAX scripts can 
manually post back the state to the server using XMLHttpRequest, 
therefore enabling the AJAX processing code to have access to the full 
view. This approach was used in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/05/ajaxian_faces_p.html" rel="nofollow">Progress Bar</a> JSF component. The name of the parameter is<code>javax.faces.ViewState</code>.</p></li><li><p>Expose an application wide ResourceBundle to the EL.</p><p>We
 have added a new &lt;resource-bundle&gt; element to the faces-config 
that allows you to list zero or more resource bundles that should be 
exposed to the EL using the new ELResolver chain. Doing this allows 
performance optimizations that prevent the need to create a 
ResourceBundle for every request.</p></li><li><p>API classes use generics</p><p>In
 response to strong Expert Group demand, we have applied Java SE 5.0 
Generics to the JSF api. Therefore, the minimum JDK requirement for JSF 
1.2 is Java SE 5.0. I'm told that it's possible to retroweave a binary 
to make it run under 1.4, but of course that configuration is not 
supported or recommended by Sun.</p></li></ul><span></span><p>All of these features and more are currently available in the JSF implementation found in Sun's Open Source Appserver, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">glassfish</a>.</p><span></span><p>Now, the outline of changes is available <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/outline.html/20050825-outline.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
