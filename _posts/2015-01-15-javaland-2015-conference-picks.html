<div class="jive-rendered-content"><h1>JavaLand 2015 Conference Picks</h1><p>With
 only 44 business days to go until JavaLand 2015, I’d like to share my 
conference picks. I’m including my sessions for completeness, and 
naturally I recommend you attend them, but I’ll also include an 
alternate that I’d attend ]]&gt;</p><h2>Tuesday, 24 March 2015</h2><dl><dt>0900, Wintergarden, Welcome Keynote: 20 Years of Java</dt><dd><p>I like to attend the plenary sessions of a conference if they are at all interesting, and Oracle Java engineer <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/lagergren" rel="nofollow">Marcus Lagergren’s</a> looks great. It will be on the big stage. <a href="http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/big-room.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img __embedded_id="398" src="20150115_files/big-room.html" style="float: right;" width="100"></a>This year I’m celebrating my own 20 year anniversary with Java, since <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.flux.utah.edu/%7Ekwright/paper_summs/network_papers/mweb-w3c96.html" rel="nofollow">I was present</a> at the German debut of Java at the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980214105213/http://www.igd.fhg.de/www/www95/www95.html" rel="nofollow">The Third International World-Wide Web Conference in Darmstadt, Germany</a> in April 1995. I vividly remember someone (<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/avh" rel="nofollow">Arthur van Hoff</a> I think) typing, as root <code>rm -rf /*</code>, at the end of the demo on a Sun UNIX workstation. What flair!</p></dd><dt>1000, Schauspielhaus, Praktisches API-Design</dt><dd><p>Dieser Vortrag wird auf Deutsch gegeben, aber trotzdem empfehle sie ich weil das Thema nebem meinem Hertz liegt. <a href="http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/schauspielhaus.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img __embedded_id="399" src="20150115_files/schauspielhaus.html" style="float: left;" width="100" height="134"></a> Hopefully I’ll get some tips for design in JSF and Servlet.</p></dd></dl><p>1200, Quantum 1, Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective: WebSocket, JSON, &amp; JSF</p><p>This
 is my first session, and it is an overview of JavaEE 7 from the 
perspective of technologies useful to those developing JavaEE 7 backed 
apps with HTML5 user interfaces.</p><p>If I wasn’t speaking myself, I’d attend my pal <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/monacotoni" rel="nofollow">Anton Epple’s 1200, Quantum 2, Wie programmiert man JavaScript in Java.</a></p><p>1300, Schauspielhaus, The (not so) Dark Art of Performance Tuning</p><p>My good friend <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/kcpeppe" rel="nofollow">Kirk Pepperdine</a> is a global expert in this topic, and a great and entertaining speaker as well.</p><p>1400, Wintergarden, JBatch mit Apache BatchEE</p><p>Batch
 is one of those unglamorous yet essential technologies, and also one 
with a very vibrant JCP community. I remember meeting <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/michaelminella" rel="nofollow">Michael Minella</a> of Spring Batch at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://devnexus.com/s/index" rel="nofollow">DevNexus 2014</a> and he was so excited about passing the TCK. The session speaker, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/struberg" rel="nofollow">Mark Struberg</a>, is a tech titan and one of the sharpest guys I’ve had the pleasure of working with. He’s also a great speaker.</p><p>1500, Wintergarden, Where Are We At with MVC in Java EE 8</p><p>I work very closely with my co-spec lead on JSF, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/mnriem" rel="nofollow">Manfred Riem</a>, so I’m biased, but this session is sure to be great. MVC is one of the most talked about technologies in Java EE 8.</p><p>1600, Quantum 4, Confessions of an Automation Addict</p><p>I’m a bit of an automation addict myself, but the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071804285" rel="nofollow">horse I picked to ride</a> has fallen out of favor. Nonetheless, I still use it heavily.</p><p>1700, Schauspielhaus, Speed up Your Java by Turning it into Binary</p><p>John is a great speaker and industry veteran, and this talk has a provocative topic, so it is sure to be worthwhile.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p>One
 unique aspect of this conference is its location: a top-tier amusmement
 park. Think of it as a smaller mashup of Disney’s Epcot and Magic 
Kingdom, with German sensibilities. After the first day of the 
conference, some of the rides will be open to conference attendees. My 
favorite was Winja’s force. <a href="http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/winjas-force.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img __embedded_id="400" src="20150115_files/winjas-force.html" style="float: right;" width="134"></a> This is a relatively mellow roller coaster with a twist, literally. The car you sit in can rotate as it glides along the rails.</p><h2>Wednesday, 25 March 2015</h2><dl><dt>0900, Quantum 3, Developing Native Mobile Apps Using JavaScript</dt><dd><p>This is a bit outside of my bailiwick, but my friend <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/hazems" rel="nofollow">Hazem Saleh</a> is a great speaker and strong proponent of Open Source. He’s also a JSF Expert Group member.</p></dd><dt>1000, Schauspielhaus, HTTP 2.0 Comes to Java EE</dt><dd><p>This is my second session, and I’ll explain what’s in store for Servlet 4.0, with a special view towards HTTP/2.</p><p>If I wasn’t speaking, I’d definitely attend <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/svenpet" rel="nofollow">Sven Peters’s</a>
 Coding Culture session in Wintergarden. First off, Atlassian makes much
 better products than GitHub. Second, Sven is an excellent speaker, and 
third the talk is likely to be keynote worthy. I’m not glad to be up 
against him in the schedule.</p></dd><dt>1100, Wintergarden, Enterprise and Internet of Things</dt><dd><p>The Tuesday plenary is by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/nmcl" rel="nofollow">Dr. Mark Little</a>,
 who is doing a great job driving Java EE forward at JBoss. I normally 
don’t go in for IoT sessions, but Mark is sure to make it interesting.</p></dd><dt>1300, Schauspielhaus, Java EE Security: Let’s Make Something Useful</dt><dd><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/dblevins" rel="nofollow">David Blevins</a>
 is a strong community voice for improving Java EE, and security is one 
of the most challenging areas to improve. You can tell it’s hard just by
 how long it’s taken for the community to get up enough steam to tackle 
it in a proper JSR. Well, we have one now: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375" rel="nofollow">JSR-375</a>, and David will tell us how we can make the most of it.</p></dd><dt>1400, Quantum 4, Productive, Effective Development? You Weak Minded fool!</dt><dd><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/sjmaple" rel="nofollow">Simon Maple</a> has done a great job building the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/virtualJUG" rel="nofollow">Virtual JUG</a>
 into a force for good in the Java Community. He is well positioned to 
deliver this kind of talk thanks to his role at ZeroTurnaround.</p></dd><dt>1500, Quantum 1, Softwarequalität steigern</dt><dd><p>This
 appears to be a survey talk about how to effectively use some popular 
tools in practice to improve software quality. I’ve never seen <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/leichtundkross" rel="nofollow">Andreas G¨nzel</a> talk, but the topic is interesting to me.</p></dd><dt>1600, Quantum 4, Puppet für Entwickler</dt><dd><p>Now
 that Docker is all the rage, I’ll be interested to see what’s new with 
Puppet, or at least learn how these two popular sysadmin technologies 
relate to eachother. As with the previous talk, I’ve not seen <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/ithempel" rel="nofollow">Sebastian Hempel</a> speak before this.</p></dd></dl><h2>Thursday, 26 March 2015</h2><p>As mentioned <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2014/12/26/javaland-2015-training-day-teaser" rel="nofollow">in my previous entry</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/SourceKnights" rel="nofollow">Oliver Szymanski</a> and I are presenting an entry in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/programm/vertiefe-schulungstag.html" rel="nofollow">training day</a>: Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective.</p><p>JavaLand
 was great fun and very professionally enriching last year. This year 
promises to be even more so. I hope to see you there!</p></div>
