<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>My last <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2009/03/response_to_a_c.html" rel="nofollow">blog entry about JSR-314-OPEN@JCP.ORG</a>
 was over a year ago. This list is the official Expert Group (EG) 
mailing list on which the development of the JSR-314 specification (JSF 
2.0) is discussed. The information on how to subscribe/unsubscribe to 
this list changed in June 2010, but I haven't updated any existing 
information or blogged any new information about it. This is the overdue
 blog entry!</p><span></span><p><span>The new way to subscribe/unsubscribe to </span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:JSR-314-OPEN@JCP.ORG">JSR-314-OPEN@JCP.ORG</a><span> is to send mail to &lt;</span><code><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:list-request@jcp.org">list-request@jcp.org</a></code>&gt;.</p><span></span><p>To subscribe to the list <strong>in read-only mode</strong> make the subject of the email be "<a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:list-request@jcp.org?subject=subscribe%20jsr-314-open">subscribe jsr-314-open</a>".</p><span></span><p>To unsubscribe from the list, make the subject of the email be "<a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:list-request@jcp.org?subject=unsubscribe%20jsr-314-open">unsubscribe jsr-314-open</a>".</p><span></span><p><strong>Only official EG members and Extended EG members may post to the list.</strong>
 If you want to become an Extended EG member the best way to do it is to
 make yourself known to one of the existing EG members who can petition 
the EG for you to be added as an Extended EG member. In general, you'll 
need a good reason for being accepted to the Extended EG. Having lots of
 experience with and passion for JSF certainly helps.</p><span></span><p>Finally,
 there will very likely be at least one more change to how one 
subscribes to JSR-314-OPEN, but this change is waiting on the resolution
 larger issues with the JCP itself.</p><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
