I am so excited to be joining Microsoft as Principal Java Architect in
their Java Tooling and Experiences team.  I hope to help to make the
future Java on Azure, by establishing Azure as the preferred cloud for
all Java workloads.

I've been fortunate to have worked at Sun during their heyday, and I
recall from that time a great admiration for the way Microsoft focused
on developers (developers developers developers).  In particular, the
Project Rave/JavaStudio Creator effort was heavily influenced by
VisualBasic and its associated tooling.  I look forward to being a part
of that kind of company again.

I will be working with my old pal and colleague Reza Rahman to enable
Java EE and Jakarta EE developers on Azure.  We're hoping to also
support Microprofile as well.

There is a mountain of new stuff for me here, so if I've ever asked you
for technical help in the past, I will likely ask you again in the very near
future, and I'll offer the same help in return, as best I can.
