<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The
 ourfaces project is intended to be a casual, yet very useful repository
 of JavaServer Faces components. I say casual because we want have a low
 barrier to entry for adding new components to the repository. The 
project leader, Matthias Unverzagt, has made it very easy to get started
 as a contributor, in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://ourfaces.dev.java.net/#participate" rel="nofollow">four simple steps</a>. Of course, if it's easy to be a contributor, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://ourfaces.dev.java.net/#build" rel="nofollow">it's even easier to be a user</a>.</p><span></span><p>If you look at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jsfcentral.com/products/#Components" rel="nofollow">http://www.jsfcentral.com/</a>you'll
 see there are at least ten different entries for JavaServer Faces 
component libraries, and most of them are not dollar cost free, nor are 
they free software. I feel it is important to have a high quality, open 
source, dollar cost free component library for Faces, and the OurFaces 
project intends to be just that.</p><span></span><p>Let's take a look at
 how the project is structured. We've made the project easy to access by
 building the component catalog in an easy-to-deploy WAR file during the
 standard build process. This enables you to explore the runtime 
performance of the components. The source tree is broken down as 
follows.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><pre>ourfaces/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;component&gt;/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where &lt;component&gt; is one of the components in the catalog.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we have calendar, code, tree, and table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catalog/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any artifacts relating to displaying this component in the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catalog.&nbsp; These are user-level artifacts, not core component
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifacts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java code for displaying the component in the catalog

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; web/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any non-java code artifacts for displaying the component
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the catalog.&nbsp; This includes skinability, sample HTML,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSS, XML config files, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; owner.xml

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The XML file that declares the owner of this component.&nbsp; The
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; owner is responsible for everything in this component,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including its display in the catalog.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taglibrary/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The java code that makes up the UIComponent subclass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (optional) Renderer, and UIComponentTag subclass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any supporting code relating to the display of the catalog

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; platform/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any supporting code used by the components.
</pre></div><span></span><p>This framework allows the component library 
to accept contributions from arbitrary parties, while allowing each 
party to own their components in the repository. As you can see, we 
currently only have three components, so we're eager to accept more 
contributors. We hope that becoming a member of the java-enterprise 
community will give us more visibility.</p><span></span><p>Please feel free to read and post on the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://ourfaces.dev.java.net/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=337" rel="nofollow">discussion forum</a>!</p></div>
