<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>It
 was pointed out to me on the ##jsf channel on irc.freenode.net that we 
didn't have a link to the source snapshot for the JSF 1.1_01 build. This
 has been fixed and I've updated our<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/#download" rel="nofollow">java.net page</a> to include a link to the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/files/documents/1866/28023/javaserverfaces_source_20040714.class" rel="nofollow">1.1_01 source released under the Java Research License</a>.</p></div>
