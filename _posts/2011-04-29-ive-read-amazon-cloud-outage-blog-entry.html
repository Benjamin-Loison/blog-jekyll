<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>The
 analysis of the recent Amazon EBS outage has been posted on the AWS 
blog [1]. I read it and was incredibly impressed with the detail, depth,
 clarity and competency shown. Of course, they need to impress the users
 with those things because they're asking us to trust them with our 
crown jewels. Even knowing that they are in the business of instilling 
confidence, it's clear the AWS team has their act together.</p><span></span><p>The
 document explains exactly what went wrong, why it went wrong, and lists
 detailed steps they say they will take to fix it. Their approach to 
resolution has several dimensions: ranging from technical to human 
communication, to education. (If only the Final Report on the 
Investigation of the Macondo Well Blowout was so clear on the steps to 
take to prevent failure. [3]) On the education front, you may be 
interested to know that Amazon knows that developer education is a key 
element to building their platform. As such, they are offering a webinar
 series, starting Monday 2 May, about making it easier to take advantage
 of multiple Availability Zones. You can see the schedule at [2].</p><span></span><pre> [1] <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/" rel="nofollow">http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/</a>&nbsp; [2] <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://aws.amazon.com/architecture/" rel="nofollow">http://aws.amazon.com/architecture/</a>&nbsp; [3] <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://ccrm.berkeley.edu/pdfs_papers/bea_pdfs/DHSGFinalReport-March2011-tag.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ccrm.berkeley.edu/pdfs_papers/bea_pdfs/DHSGFinalReport-March2011-tag.pdf</a>
