### Raw Notes: Community-Controlled Jakarta EE with JAX-RS and MVC, Christian Kaltepoth, Markus Karg, Ivar Gramstad

#### JAX-RS

* Arrived late, Markus was sharing what has happened on the JAX-RS spec
  since it was somewhat transferred to Jakarta
  
* COMMENT: Could not read the slides.
  
* A fair amount of complaining about the roadblocks.

  * Oracle is still the official lead
  
  * We must not use the terms "Java" and "JAX-RS".
  
  * Must not publish any new features.
  
  * TCK still not under their control
  
  * Spec doc still under Oracle sole control!
  
  * COMMENT: It seems like this effort is stalled

* Getting into gear

  * Fix the above problems
  
  * pruning commiters to only active people
  
  * Publish the roadmap.
  
  * COMMENT: again, cannot read the slides.
  
#### MVC

* Christian Kaltepoth.  Bio.

* Reviewing the old Java EE 8 survey, the creation of MVC, in 2014!

* What happened next

   * Relicense under Apache 2
   
   * Migrate project structure
   
   * Finished RI
   
   * Created TCK
   
   * JCP stuff.

* Challenges

   * Trademark issues
   
   * Eclipse Development Process (EDP)
   
   * Clean intellectual property
   
   * Using the infrastructure from Eclipse.  Works well enough.
   
* What's next?

   * Finish the spec thru JCP: in the next month!
   
   * Migrate spec and TCK to Eclipse EE4J
   
   * First real release of Jakarta EE8 
   
   * Become a part of Jakarta EE 9!

#### Jakarta EE

* There is a lot going on, but we have not conveyed it to the community.

   * COMMENT: I like how he owns that they need to do better about
     communicating the mission.
     
     * Loved the timeline.

* TCK note: use a bottom up process

* IMPORTANT: Eclipse Foundation Specification Process

   * Plan to finalize at the meeting today!  JavaLand is timely again.
   
* Showed the scrum board.  Awesome.
