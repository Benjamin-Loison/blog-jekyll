    <p>About <a href="/blog/2011/04/19/jsf-logo-contest-win-free-book.html">three weeks ago</a>,
 I called for the community to submit entries for a contest to design a 
logo for the JSF specification. Sixteen different individuals submitted 
32 entries.  Thank you very much for contributing!</p>  <p>Per the recommendation of Arun Gupta and Imre OÃŸwald, I used a web voting platform to determine the winner, and here it is.</p>  <p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86648339/ridingthecrest/blog/images/20110510-jsf-logo.png"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86648339/ridingthecrest/blog/images/20110510-jsf-logo.png" alt="Official JSF Logo" width="600" height="300"></a></p>  <p>I would have uploaded it to the Official Homepage of the JSF Specification, &lt;<a href="http://jsf-spec.java.net/">http://jsf-spec.java.net/</a>&gt;, but this bug &lt;<a href="http://kenai.com/jira/browse/KENAI-2654">http://kenai.com/jira/browse/KENAI-2654</a>&gt; is preventing me from doing so.</p>  <p>Many
 thanks to Wilber and all who submitted entries.  If Wilber wants to 
plug something, such his twitter account or blog, he can put a comment 
on this blog entry.  I'll be sending the book his way within the week.</p>   <p><span class="technoratitag">  Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="tag">edburns</a></span></p>
