<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I'm pleased to report that we <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2004/06/welcome_to_the.html#3800" rel="nofollow">finally</a>
 have annonced the terms of the Java Distribution License (JDL) as it 
applies to the Sun JavaServer Faces Reference Implementation, and to 
JavaServer Faces implementations at large. It is now possible to 
electronically accept the JavaServer Faces JDL and produce official, 
compliant implementations of JavaServer Faces technology. The JDL also 
covers fee-based access to the JavaServer Faces TCK. If you're seriously
 interested in paying for access to the TCK, contact me and I'll forward
 you to the proper party. It's rather expensive so serious inquiries 
only.</p><span></span><p>I have updated the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/faq.html#Code_checkout" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a>entry with links that allow you to accept either the JRL or the JDL.</p><span></span><p>Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a>.</p></div>
