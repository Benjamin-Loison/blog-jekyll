<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Is
 it just me or do you also feel that java.net will never be a leading 
open source community without having its own irc server? Mozilla has 
one, Netbeans uses freenode, the list goes on and on. It's just a great 
way to do realtime collaboration. For example, in my case if we had a 
channel for JavaServer Faces, users could get in touch with developers 
right away. Also, if we had one for the JavaServer Faces EG, expert 
group members could chat about things in real time and resolve issues 
faster.</p><span></span><p>I filed a <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java-net.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=149" rel="nofollow">bug</a>on this at java.net, which was closed due to lack of interest.
