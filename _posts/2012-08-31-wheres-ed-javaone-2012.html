<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>JavaOne 2012 is just 19 business days away!</p><p>In
 previous years I spent the time to extract an HTML view from my google 
calendar to show where I would be during the week of JavaOne 2012. This 
year, I don't have the time to do that so I'm going to just post an 
image. Sorry for the degradation in usefulness.</p><p><a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/scratch/20120831-edburns-javaone-2012-schedule.png"><img src="20120831_files/20120831-edburns-javaone-2012-schedule.png"></a></p><p>In
 previous years, I would have made this an image map with links to the 
actual sessions in the content catalog. Again, due to time constraints I
 must be content with just sharing a link to the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone&amp;customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">Content Catalog</a>
 and asking you to type in session IDs. I hope it's good enough. I defer
 to Voltaire, who said that the perfect is the enemy of the good. Please
 trust that the time I would have spent making this blog entry more 
useful will be spent in making my JavaOne content better!</p><p><span class="technoratitag"> Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
