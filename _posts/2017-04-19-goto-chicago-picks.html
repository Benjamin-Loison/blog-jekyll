<p>I am very blessed with the opportunity to be speaking at this
years <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/schedule">GOTO Chicago 2017</a>
conference.  I will be dusting off the old Rockstar Programmers talk and
refreshing it up with some new interviews.  Ahead of the conference I want
  to share my conference picks.</p>

<h2>Monday &mdash; Conference Day One</h2>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>09:15  Zurich Ballroom <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/47">Software Design in the 21st Century</a></p>

            <p>Martin Fowler is one of the enduring luminaries in our
            very quick changing field.  To stay as consistently
            influential as he has, for as long as he has is a great
            indicator that he is the real deal.  His abstract is
            sufficiently high level that he could pretty much go
            anywhere with it, so I'm curious to see the specific under
            the general.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>10:35 Zurich
	  EFG <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/62">Patterns
	  of Effective Teams</a></p>

            <p>My talk is on the people track and I've long been a fan
            of <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>.  In
            fact, I quoted heavily, with attribution, from
            his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw1dgUS27uE">The
            Browser is Dead</a> talk in some of my own talks.  Dan will
            be covering so character attributes of effective teams.
            That's right up my alley.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>11:40 Zurich AFG <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/63">Give and Take: Handling Constructive Criticism and Creative Conflict Like A Pro</a></p>

            <p>I'm so glad to see this topic being addressed.  While the
            notion of "failing fast" is now seen as a good thing, I find
            at the individual level people still have a hard time with
            the particular manifestation of failure known as
            constructive
            criticism.  <a href="https://captainawkward.com/">Jennifer
            Peepas</a> has a very diverse background full of things not
            commonly seen at IT conferences.  This should be great.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>13:30 Zurich ABCD <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/44">Troubleshooting Tiered Tragedy: A Peek Into Failure</a></p>

            <p>Say what you will about monoliths, at least your logs are
            all in one place and there is no need for complex
            aggregation systems.  Massively distributed systems are now
            much more widespread, so it's a good idea to understand how
            to not give up the failure fidelity at the same
            time.  <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkAndNerdy">Jeff
            Smith</a> will literally break it down for us.</p>

          </li>
          
	  <li><p>My session is in this slot, 14:35 in Zurich EFG.  I am
	  reprising my Secrets of the Rock Star Programmers talk based
	  on the book for which this website was built.  If I wasn't
	  giving the talk, I'd probably be
	  at <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/51">Brian Ray's
	  Cognitive from the Engineering perspective</a>.  Deloitte is a
	  global consulting powerhouse, so I want to see what they are
	      doing with all this machine learning stuff.</p> </li>

	  <li><p>16:45 Vevey 12 <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/54">Javaloution! (How I learned to stop worrying and play Jenga! with the entire software industry. What could possibly go wrong?”)</a></p>

            <p>Naturally I need to check out my
            colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/gsaab">Georges
            Saab</a>'s session about the experience of bringing Jigsaw
            to the world.  I've seen from the inside how hard it is to
            evolve a developer platform in my work
            on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsf_spec">JSF</a>.  Doing it
            with all of Java is much more complicated.</p>

        <h2>Tuesday &mdash; Conference Day Two</h2>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>09:15 Zurich Ballroom <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/86">Debugging under fire: Keeping your head when systems have lost their mind</a></p>

            <p>I never had the pleasure of working with Bryan Cantrill
            during our overlapping time at Sun, but I gather he can be a
            polarizing figure.  He's certainly had a wild ride of it
            with node.js and I'm sure he has some gripping stories to
            tell, which I look forward to hearing.</p>

          </li>


	  <li><p>10:35 St. Galen 3 <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/164">Old Geeks Yell At Cloud</a></p>

            <p>I still use XEmacs to read my email, so I get the whole
            curmudgeon thing.  I've been
            following <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout">Bridget
            Kromhout</a> for a while so I look forward to seeing her
            sessions.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>11:40 Vevey 34 <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/72">We can’t have a progressive web without embracing it</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8">Chris Heilmann</a>
            has a few things in common with my old
            pal <a href="https://twitter.com/cwilso">Chris Wilson</a>:
            they have similar twitter hairstyles, they are both named
            Chris, and the both had something to do with browsers at
            Microsoft.  Let's see what he has to say about the state of
            the web.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>13:30 Zurich EFG <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/76">Developers _are_ Researchers - Improve the work you love with Research Driven Development</a></p>

            <p>I love the premise of this talk.  It's so meta.  Let's
            apply research techniques to how we do our jobs.</p>
          </li>

	  <li><p>14:35 Zurich ABCD <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/79">Effective Microservices in a Data-Centric World</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/randyshoup">Randy Shoup</a>
            is doing Microservices at StitchFix.  Knowing how things are
            going at GILT, I think this should be a fun talk.  Plus, I
            want to see how well dressed he is.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>15:40 Vevey 34 <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/64">Making the web frameworks titans feel tiny</a></p>

            <p>Taking away deficiencies in web frameworks is something
            in which I have a keen interest.  Let's see
            what <a href="https://twitter.com/Martndemus">Marten
            Schilstra</a> has to say.</p>
            
          </li>

          <li><p>16:45 Zurich ABCD <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/85">One journey, many paths: A pragmatic guide for migrating to microservices</a></p>

            <p>I've been thinking a lot about monoliths and
            microservices lately.  It's always good to have a fresh
            perspective on this hot topic of our
            times.  <a href="https://twitter.com/zhamakd">Zhamak
            Dehghani</a> is in a great position to offer it.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>18:00 Zurich Ballroom <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2017/sessions/32">Closing Keynote: Meeting resistance and moving forward</a></p>

            <p>I had the chance to meet Linda Rising at Jazoon 2007 or
            so and she is a fascinating person and engaging speaker.  A
            great way to close this conference.</p>
