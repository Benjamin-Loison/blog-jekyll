# VSCode

* Started by saying their goal is not to convert IntelliJ, Eclipse,
  NetBeans devs.
  
* Editors

   * TextEdit
   
   * SublimeText
   
   * jEdit
   
      * Had huge plugin ecosystem.  From sourceforge
      
   * [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
   
* On the other end of the spectrum you have IDEs.

* Text editors

   * Keyboard centric
   
   * Lightweight/fast
   
   * Files/folders
   
* IDEs

   * Project systems
   
   * Integrated build
   
   * Debug
   
   * VCS
   
   * Code understandig
   
* What about something in the middle?

  * VS Code is an editor, but has some capabilities from the IDS
  
     * Code understanding
     
     * Debug
     
     * Everything from the Text editors
     
* If you want to stick to one editor, VSCode + extensions.

* Spring Initializr

* IntelliCode

   * AI-assited pattern recognition
   
## DEMOS

* Setting it up.

```
code --user-dir empty --extensions-dir empty/extensions
```

* Some basic things you can do

   * Maven projects
   
   * Had some demo issues
   
# Spring

## DEMOS

* SpringBoot `@RestController`.

* Initializr

   * Go-to-symbol works with Spring beans
   
   * PetClinic
   
* AzureDevSpaces

   * Rapidly iterate and debug containers in Kubernetes
   
   * Showed how you can drop in a new Service-B in the midst of other
     existing services.
