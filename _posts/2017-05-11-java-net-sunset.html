<p>The long
awaited <a href="https://community.oracle.com/community/java/javanet-forge-sunset">java.net
forge sunset</a> has finally come to pass.  Before there was github,
before there was google code, when sourceforge was a hot new thing,
there was java.net.  I always felt that java.net was the tip of Sun's
open source spear, whose shape was influenced in no small part by former
Sun CEO <a href="https://jonathanischwartz.wordpress.com/">Jonathan
Schwartz</a>.  In fact the motto of java.net spoke of this role:</p>

<p>In fact the first <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2004-06-28-welcome-javaserver-tm-faces-implementation-project %}">blog
post I ever made</a> was made to the java.net CMS, before there was such
a term as CMS.  Over the years, java.net hosted GlassFish, OpenJDK (for
a time), JSF, Facelets, JAX-RS, JMS, EJB, JavaMail, Jersey, Grizzly,
WebSocket, and many more.  I'd like to take this blog post to thank
those who ran java.net over the years, and more vitally, to thank those
who have played a role in migrating the Java EE content over to GitHub
and Groups.io.  I tried to not leave anyone out, but if I have, let me
know and I'll add them.  So, here's to you java.net and to all the
people who have helped keep it running and migrate its content to new
  homes.</p>

<h2>Thanks to those who made the java.net migration a success</h2>
