<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Because I was presenting <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/" rel="nofollow">MCP</a> at the first ever <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jazoon.com/" rel="nofollow">Jazoon conference</a>,
 my friend and expert JSF Developer Alexander Jesse invited me to speak 
at the first ever JSF User Group meeting. The meeting was held at a <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.credit-suisse.com/" rel="nofollow">Credit Suisse</a> office in ZÃ¼rich on the evening of the last day of the Jazoon conference.</p><span></span><p>Credit
 Suisse is the largest financial institution to go public with its 
investment in JSF, though I have it on good authority that Deutsche 
Bank, and Oesterreichische Kontrollbank also have made significant 
investments in JSF. Mr. Jesse's <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentations/wp/1400" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>at
 Jazoon detailed how Credit Suisse has achieved significant advances in 
developer productivity, UI uniformity, and maintainability by creating a
 custom JSF component library specific to the needs of Credit Suisse IT 
developers. Mr. Jesse printed up flyers announcing the JSF user group 
meeting and these were distributed in the Sun and Credit Suisse booths 
in the exhibitor area, as well as at every one of the five JSF related 
presentations at Jazoon.</p><span></span><p>The primary goals of this 
inaugural meeting was to decide if there was a need for a JSF user group
 in Switzerland, should the group be a special interest group (SIG) 
within <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jugs.ch/" rel="nofollow">JUGs</a>
 or a standalone group, and how often should the group meet. 
Secondarily, Mr. Jesse and I would present some fun technical content, 
not found anywhere else at Jazoon.</p><span></span><p>The slides from the meeting can be found here:</p><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/scripting-jsf.odp" rel="nofollow">Scripting JSF</a></p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/20070628-swiss-jsf-user-group-jsf-2_0.odp" rel="nofollow">JSF 2.0</a></p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/20070628-jsf-ug-ch.ppt" rel="nofollow">Alexander Jesse Slides</a> JSF, Quo Vadis (in German)</p></li></ul><span></span><p>We
 had about 22 people attending the meeting, about half of whom had heard
 of it from the conference. The response was enthusiastic. Alexander's 
notes from the meeting can be found at his blog, at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://ajesse.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/jsf-usergroup-ch-meeting-1/" rel="nofollow">http://ajesse.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/jsf-usergroup-ch-meeting-1/</a>&gt;.</p><span></span><p>Please leave a comment on this blog if you're interested in the next meeting.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
