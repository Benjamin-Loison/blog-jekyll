<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I was doing some C++ hacking today, and I added the traditional:</p><span></span><pre>#ifndef MYINTERFACENAME_H
#define MYINTERFACENAME_H
</pre><span></span><p>preprocessor magic in my .h file and it occurred 
to me: normally I don't even question having to type such nonsense in 
C++, I just live with it. Exploring this train of thought more 
completely, I realized that C++ has never gone through a concerted 
ease-of-development effort as Java has been going through over the past 
few years. Why is that? Is it because <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/homepage.html" rel="nofollow">Mr. Stroustrup</a>doesn't care about <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.developer.com/design/article.php/3432191" rel="nofollow">the corporate developer</a>?
 Is it because no one company is betting its future on the success of 
C++, and therefore there is no need to expand the ranks of the 
developer?</p><span></span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
