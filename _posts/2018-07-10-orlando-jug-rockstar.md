I'm blessed with the opportunity to present the current version of my
"Secrets of the Rockstar Programmers" talk at a special edition of the
Orlando Java User's Group.  JUG leader Mike Levin is even more blessed
with the opportunity to visit [JCrete](http://www.jcrete.org/), and so
chose to re-schedule the July meeting rather than canceling it.

As usual, there is free pizza!
