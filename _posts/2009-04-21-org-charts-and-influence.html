<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Nearly
 every work related thought I have now ends with, “but this could change
 because of the Oracle thing.” The subject of this blog is one of them. 
While riding the ICE train to Mainz after speaking at JUG Köln, I was 
catching up on email and came across a (likely now irrelevant) org chart
 for some group other than my own. I noticed a box filled with the names
 of individual contributors that lead straight to a Director level 
person, rather than going to a middle-manager first. I’ve seen such 
boxes on many org charts at Sun, and the corresponding inter-personal 
pattern for those whose names reside in such boxes is often, “I have 
more influence because I report directly to a Director”. This notion 
seems to be encouraged in the Sun culture as a carrot to motivate 
engineers who <em>do</em> report to a middle manager to want to become 
“more senior“ by getting into one of those boxes. The thinking is that 
influence can be measured by your tree-depth in the org chart. I’m happy
 to report that this is not the only path to having influence at Sun 
(but it does appear to be the better recognized one).</p><p>Here’s the 
path I’ve chosen. Rather than seeking to differentiate myself by 
communicating my value-add for maximum Sun-internal visibility, I 
decided to invest more effort in looking outward to help grow and engage
 in a community of developers around a specific technology, namely JSF. 
Whatever influence I perceive I’ve earned as a result of this decision 
comes not from my position in the pecking order, but from direct 
engagement with the community. I may not have the direct ear of upper 
management, but by engaging the community, and helping to advocate and 
influence their vision of how JSF should evolve, I have the indirect ear
 of upper management. I think this is a better path for me because I 
believe the voice of the community should carry more weight with, and be
 heard more clearly by, upper management. Such an approach certainly 
brings upper management closer to the customer, which is the cornerstone
 of building shareholder value. Thankfully Sun does support and 
recognize this path to seniority, but acceptance appears to be spotty 
across the company as a whole. Jonathan Schwartz’s emphasis on employee 
blogging is one way that Sun supports this path. Of course, all this 
    could change because of the Oracle thing.</p><p><span class="technoratitag"> Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>

I believe Oracle is big into JSF. So this Oracle thing may be good for you.
