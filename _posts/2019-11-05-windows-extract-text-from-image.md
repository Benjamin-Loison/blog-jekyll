I frequently use the extract text feature on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9
phone and recently asked myself, "hey, I wonder if I can do this on
Windows also?"  Of course you can.  Here's how I do it.  Perhaps there's
an easier way.  If so, please let me know in the comments.

1. Use snipping tool to grab the text you want to extract.  For example,

   ![text to capture]({{ site.url }}/blog/assets/20191105-text-to-capture-01.png "text to capture")

   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;   

2. Open OneNote and drag the image to a scratch page.

3. Context-click the image and choose "Copy Text from Picture"

   ![Copy text from picture]({{ site.url }}/blog/assets/20191105-text-to-capture-02.png "Copy text from picture")
