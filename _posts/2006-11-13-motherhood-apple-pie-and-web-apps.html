<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>In my recent spate of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2006/09/speaking_at_the.html" rel="nofollow">speaking engagements</a>, I have been including a "<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/21/motherhood-and-apple-pie/" rel="nofollow">motherhood and apple pie</a>"
 slide in my presentations about JSF and Ajax. I put this in my slides 
in response to a question I sometimes hear when I make the case for JSF 
and Ajax. The question goes something like this:</p><span></span><blockquote class="jive-quote">Hey,
 why do I need JSF, or any other server side framework for that matter? 
With Ajax, or things like GWT, can't I just put it all in the client? I 
mean, let's just do everything in JavaScript!</blockquote><span></span><p>You're welcome to do that, <strong>but</strong> if you do, please know that you'll have to do all of these things yourself.<img alt="Screen capture of slide showing basic requirements of web apps" class="jive-external-image" style="float:right;" width="341" height="253">
 As you may guess, JSF already does all of these for you, does them 
quite well, and does them in a way that is an industry standard, with 
the brainpower of leading minds from Oracle, Sun, IBM, Apache, the Open 
Source Community, and others.</p><span></span><p>This is why I have been spending my spare time trying to get <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://ajax.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Project jMaki</a>
 to have first class support for JSF as a core part of its feature set 
and value proposition. In fact, if you support this idea, please send an
 email to <a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:users@ajax.dev.java.net?subject=No%20Beta%20without%20full%20JSF%20support">the jMaki User list</a> saying that you think this is important.
