--------------------------------

Your leader "[The New Ideology of Race]({{ site.url }}/blog/assets/20200711-economist-leader-new-ideology-of-race.pdf)" asserts, "Liberalism thrives on a marketplace of ideas...[and] uses facts and evidence, tested in debate, to help the weak take on the strong."  Unfortunately, the corresponding new ideology of the American right has subverted liberalism, successfully equating it with ill-defined labels such as Antifa, and completely destroying the very concept of "facts and evidence".  As for "debate", that requires good faith, and the American right has defined good faith as weakness.  The proponents of the "New Ideology of Race" understand this reality.  To slow the slide toward irrelevance, "Liberalism" must understand it as well.
