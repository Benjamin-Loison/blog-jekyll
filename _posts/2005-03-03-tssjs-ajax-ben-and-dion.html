&nbsp; Not possible too create rich ui only inbrowser

II What is ajax

&nbsp; A. History: HTML-&gt;JS-&gt;Applets-&gt;Flash (Back Button) and SVG (Not impl)

&nbsp; B. JS Pain 1998
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; debugging was nightmare

&nbsp;&nbsp; xp pain

 C. Defining

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asynchronous JavaScript and XmlHttpRequest

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards based presentation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use XML to manipulate data with XSLT

&nbsp; D. Client model

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more single request/response restrictions, more flexibility to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go back to server at will.

&nbsp; E. Can do it asynchronous, it's a big deal because it changes the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request/response paradigm.&nbsp; Gets rid of submit button

&nbsp; F. A bit on how

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. still have to do the browser detection thing, but can be abstracted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. showed the code to do the request, handle the response, by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; installing a JS callback.&nbsp; Get the response as XML, use dom to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extract info, use dom to put it back into the form.

&nbsp; G. History of the XmlHttpRequest, methods on it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open(), send(), can pass basic auth credentials. (What about certs?)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JS has function pointers

&nbsp; H. Ecmascript for XML (E4X)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build dom straight into Ecmascript
&nbsp; 
III Who's doing it

&nbsp; A. Google: maps

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; images are tiled.&nbsp; Requested asynchronously, that's how panning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works.&nbsp; JS supports layering, with transparent images.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They use IFRAME, which allows history to work.&nbsp; 

&nbsp; B. Google maps becomes a platform

&nbsp;&nbsp; When you get into this world, you are building a platform
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are lucky, there will be a Google hacks on the way.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of cool hack out there already

&nbsp; C. Google suggest

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aim: let you know what people are searching

&nbsp; D. TadaList

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built on Ruby on Rails

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple List component, keeps server side component updated.

IV General Framework

&nbsp; A. General Solns

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRUD on the DOM

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideal for portals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animations, feedback messages

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback messages: just show a message and not re-display the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting from the Admin Panel

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tree control, delete a node, don't re-render the tree: just nuke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it from the DOM.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recalculate:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not recalculate on the fly?

&nbsp; B. SOAP access

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESTful web services.

&nbsp; C. Frameworks: Custom...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listed examples of common things you can specify as patterns of usage.&nbsp; 

&nbsp; D. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightweight format to get objects back that are not XML.&nbsp; Built on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object, Array, String, Number, etc

&nbsp; E. JSON RPC: essentially a Java ORB

&nbsp; F. JavaScript Templates

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manipulating the DOM is a pain.&nbsp; Use templating.&nbsp; Basically, allow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameterized DOM access.

&nbsp; G. AOP with JavaScript?&nbsp; Yes, you can.&nbsp; 

&nbsp; H. How to fit with frameworks?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have component that integrates this functionality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can register a component with tapestry that will receive all the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requests dynamically.

&nbsp;&nbsp; (I'll be talking with Ben immediately after this talk)

&nbsp; I. JSUnit: how to do test first with JavaScript.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Solenium

V RSS Reader Demo

&nbsp; Show you can build an offline capable application with AJAX.

VI Conclusion, warnings

&nbsp; A. Warnings

&nbsp; Don't use for technoligies sake.

&nbsp; Understand Usability testing

&nbsp; Understand restrictions

&nbsp; Still in creative mode

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frameworks will be coming, take the work out of it

&nbsp; B. JS Survival tips

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll miss the IDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Packaging as source only lets people see source code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debugging, tougher, firefox, mozilla has something

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Packaging libraries: be wary of namespace.&nbsp; The packaging scheme is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; basic

&nbsp; C. JS Limitations,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't access resources on other sites: wrong, must sign code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signed code can also read from and write to the local filesystem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to get permission in every function.

&nbsp; D. ajaxian.com

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't build your own framework.&nbsp; It's probably been done before.
