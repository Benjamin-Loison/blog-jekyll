<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>This
 blog just collects some bugs I've filed on NetBeans and the fixes and 
workarounds they have. Also, I want to take this opportunity to say that
 the netbeans team is incredibly responsive to bug reports, especially 
finding and marking duplicates. Us users really appreciate it. 
Personally, as a member of Sun's JSF team, you are an inspiration for me
 to be more responsive to my bugs!</p><span></span><ul><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=60235" rel="nofollow">The focus lost bug</a></p><p>This
 one appears to be Mac only and apparently the result of a bug in the 
Mac JDK, which has been filed. Tim Bray reported the following 
workaround:</p><blockquote class="jive-quote">There is a well-known workaround: using the menu, select Edit/Find. Dismiss the dialogue and you have focus back.</blockquote></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=61615" rel="nofollow">Expand the projects node to the document that currently has the focus.</a></p><p>I
 love this one. On the Mac, with emacs mode enabled, the shortcut is 
Shift-Meta-1. Likewise for the files and and favorites tab it's 
Shift-Meta-2 and Shift-Meta-3 respectively.</p></li><li><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=60949" rel="nofollow">Support for package-info.java</a></p><p>There is now a wizard for creating package-info.java. Nice.</p>&nbsp; <span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></li></ul><span></span><p>There are many more but that's all I have time for now.</p></div>
