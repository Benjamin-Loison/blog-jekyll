<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Emmanuel Bernard has been doing a fine job running JSR-303 Bean
Validation.&nbsp; I've met with him on a number of occasions and it's always
been a pleasant, productive and professional encounter.&nbsp; It was with
great interest that I read the JSF2.0 proposal appendix in the
soon-to-be-released JSR-303 draft.&nbsp; I'll leave the details until JSR-303
hits their PR, but at this point I can say I'm happy with the job the
JSR-303 EG has done as evidenced in this proposal.&nbsp; They've left graph
validation off the table for now, but aside from that, it fits right
in.</p>
