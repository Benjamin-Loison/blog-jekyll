 like to offer my thoughts on how Microsoft and Sun have approached the 
problem of bringing more "ease of development" to their respective 
platforms. According to Mr. Grimes's article, Microsoft marketing was 
behind the introduction of VB.NET. Their motivation was to free the 
massive numbers of developers they had won with VB from the shackles of a
 single-threaded non-OO language, while still retaining those massive 
numbers firmly in the Microsoft development camp. Their approach to do 
this was marketing driven, and resulted in the creation of a backwards 
incompatible language, with an implementation of inconsistent quality, 
that is marketed as being backwards compatible with VB. Sun's motivation
 for "ease of development" was, "we have a great, powerful, easy to use,
 language, but damn, look at all those VB developers!" Sun's approach, 
rather than being marketing driven, was engineering driven. We chose to 
develop easy to use tools and technologies (like <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/jscreator/" rel="nofollow">Java Studio Creator</a> and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://research.sun.com/technical-reports/2005/abstract-128.html" rel="nofollow">DASL</a>)
 and add selective, highly considered, features to the core language. I 
contend that right now Sun's approach has yielded a more successful 
result in terms of "ease of development", and it's starting to yield a 
good result in terms also of developer capture as well.</p></div>
