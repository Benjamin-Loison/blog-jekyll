<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>It's hard to know the exact numbers, but I'll venture a guess that <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://bit.ly/realworldjsflinks" rel="nofollow">well over half of the JSF sites that exist in the world</a>
 are running Oracle's Mojarra implementation of the JSF spec.&nbsp; Did 
you know that this implemention is the first large part of JavaEE (then 
J2EE) to be open-sourced, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2004/06/welcome_to_the.html" rel="nofollow">way back in 2004</a>?&nbsp; As with any decent open source project, we have <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://hudson.glassfish.org/view/JSF%20Mojarra/" rel="nofollow">public continuous integration</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://community.oracle.com/blogs/edburns/2011/05/19/jsf.java.net/checkout/" rel="nofollow">a public version control system (VCS)</a>, and public source browsing tools.&nbsp; This last part is the subject of this blog entry.</p>&nbsp; <p>First, ohloh.&nbsp; If you don't have an ohloh account yet, please get one at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oloh.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oloh.net/</a>&gt;.&nbsp;
 It has the"social coding" part of the whole GitHUB thing (without 
octocats, sadly) but not bound to any one VCS technology.&nbsp; Mauricio
 Scheffer has a nice blog entry listing the benefits of Ohloh in the 
panoply of similar technologies. &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/03/overview-of-my-oss-projects.html" rel="nofollow">http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/03/overview-of-my-oss-projects.html</a>&gt;.&nbsp; The ohloh project page for Mojarra is at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/Mojarra" rel="nofollow">https://www.ohloh.net/p/Mojarra</a>&gt;.</p>&nbsp; <p>Second,
 svnsearch.&nbsp; These days, svn is to git as XML was to Java 
annotationsfour years ago.&nbsp; Quite possibly the worst thing about 
svnsearch is the name, and that's only if your a git snob.&nbsp; It 
seems to have a nice interface and seems to be very solid.&nbsp; Vcsism 
aside, I like it.&nbsp; The svnsearch project page for Mojarra is at
