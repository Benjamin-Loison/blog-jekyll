<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>With
 the demise of the Sun Engineer's Sandbox, my content posted there has 
disappeared. Thankfully I saved a copy. Thanks to srcerer on <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces" rel="nofollow">the ##jsf chat room on freenode</a> for reminding me to repost this.</p><span></span><h2>Overview</h2><span></span><p>To celebrate the release of Ruby on Rails (RoR) 1.0, I have taken the <i><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Flash.html" rel="nofollow">flash</a></i>concept from Rails's <code>ActionController</code>
 and brought it to JSF. For those unfamiliar with RoR or the flash, the 
flash is basically a map whose entries have a finite, container enforced
 lifetime. The concept is familiar; it's the same old "scope" concept 
used in the "request", "session" and "application" classes in the 
Servlet spec. The point of the flash is to hold information you discover
 on <strong>this</strong> request, that you want to use on the<strong>next</strong> request, but want to be forgotten after the next request is finished</p><span></span><p>Figure 1 is a cheesy graphical depiction of the request, flash, dialog, session, and application scopes.</p><span></span><p><a href="https://community.oracle.com/blogs/edburns/2006/03/01/fig1.jpg"><img src="20060301_files/fig1.html"></a></p><span></span><p>The
 nice thing about these scopes is that they all have a Map into which 
you can stick things. These Maps have the special property that they 
will be cleared when the scope ends. In the case of the flash, the map 
is cleared after exactly two runs through the JSF request processing 
lifecycle.</p><span></span><p>I included Shale's <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://struts.apache.org/struts-shale/features-dialog-manager.html" rel="nofollow">Dialog</a>
 concept for good measure since I believe this concept is important to 
the future of JSF For example, it's so important that JBoss Seam <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://docs.jboss.com/seam/reference/en/html/tutorial.html#d0e778" rel="nofollow">also provides a similar concept</a>. A Shale dialog or Seam conversation is a scope whose length is determined by the application developer.</p><span></span><h2>Background</h2><span></span><p>Of course, I needed a release-vehicle for this thing so I created a new <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">glassfish</a> sub-project on java.net called <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">jsf-extensions</a>.
 My intent is to use this project for a number of extensions to the core
 jsf implementation. The flash is just the first the first that is ready
 for public use. Others in the works include:</p><span></span><ul><li><p>A completion and implementation of Jacob Hookom's <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jhook/archive/2005/09/jsf_avatar_vs_m_1.html" rel="nofollow">JSF Avatar proposal</a></p></li><li><p>A
 generalization of the Sun JSF implementation's JSP tag library 
generator. This tool is used in the Sun implementation to generate the 
TLD and tag handlers for the html_basic taglib from the existing 
standard JSF component metadata in the<code>standard-html-renderkit.xml</code> file. The idea is to generalize this tool so it can be used to generate the taglib for any JSF component.</p></li><li><p>A generalization of the <code>PhaseListener</code> approach used in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://bpcatalog.dev.java.net/nonav/ajax/jsf-ajax/frames.html" rel="nofollow">Sun Blueprints Solutions Catalog AJAX components</a>
 to serve up JavaScript files so that it can serve up any file out of a 
component jar. This problem is solved in MyFaces using the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk/extensionsFilter.html" rel="nofollow">Extensions Filter</a> but a PhaseListener is a more self-container approach. This problem is also solved by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblets.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">the Weblets Project</a>
 but personally I don't think the problem of loading resources is big 
enough to warrant an entire top-level project. Also, weblets has extra 
XML configuration steps that simply are not necessary if you use the 
PhaseListener approach.</p></li></ul><span></span><p>But enough about the future of <code>jsf-extensions</code>, let's quickly examine how to use the flash by examining the sample war included in the jsf-extensions download.</p><span></span><h2>Getting Started</h2><span></span><ul><li><p>Download and unpack the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/files/documents/4420/25753/jsf-extensions-0.1alpha1.zip" rel="nofollow">jsf-extensions download</a>.</p></li><li><p>Download a recent build of glassfish, I used <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=3072" rel="nofollow">Build 31</a>.</p></li><li><p>Start it up by going to the <code>bin</code> directory and running:</p><pre>./asadmin start-domain domain1
</pre></li><li><p>Then deploy the sample app by executing:</p><pre>./asadmin deploy --user admin --password adminadmin ~/jsf-extensions-1.0alpha1/wars/run-time-test-0.1.war
</pre><p>Of course, you need to adjust your path to the war accordingly. The app will then be accessible at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://localhost:8080/run-time-test-0.1/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/run-time-test-0.1/</a>. This will take you to an index page where you should click on the "Ruby on Rails-style Flash" link.</p></li></ul><span></span><h2>App Traversal</h2><span></span><p>This
 app illustrates using the Flash from JSP. It is also possible to use 
the flash directly from Java Code, or via the EL API. These latter two 
methods are described in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/apidocs/com/sun/faces/el/FlashELResolver.html" rel="nofollow">JavaDocs</a>.</p><span></span><p>As you may know from <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/reference/techart/unifiedEL.html" rel="nofollow">Jennifer and Pierre's article on the Unified EL</a>,
 JSF expressions can be accessed in a "get" context, or a "set context",
 otherwise known as "rvalue" or "lvalue", respectively. Thefore, the EL 
Expression <code>#{flash.foo}</code> will store a value into the hash 
under the key "foo" when evaluated as an lvalue, while it will retrieve 
the value under key "foo" from the flash when evaluated as an rvalue.</p><span></span><p>In
 JSP pages, most expressions act as rvalues, whereas the lvalue behavior
 does not occurr until the form is submitted and the values entered by 
the user are stored into the expressions. However, to make it easier to 
set expression values from JSP, including setting into the flash, the 
jsf-extensions library includes the <code>jsfExt:set</code> tag. A simple usage of this tag found on the first page in the sample app, flash.jsp, is shown below.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="border:1px solid black;"><pre><span>

&nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;

&nbsp; &lt;body&gt;
&lt;f:view&gt;

&nbsp; &lt;h:form id="form1"&gt;

&nbsp; &lt;h:panelGrid columns="2" border="1" width="600"&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Store into the flash when rendering this page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;jsfExt:set var="#{flash.foo}" value="fooValue" /&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value of &lt;code&gt;\#{flash.foo}&lt;/code&gt;, should be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h:outputText value="#{flash.foo}" /&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h:commandButton value="reload" /&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h:commandButton value="next" action="next" /&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/h:panelGrid&gt;

&nbsp; &lt;/h:form&gt;

&lt;/f:view&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><p>We're using the panelGrid tag (in way we not possible before JSF 1.2, due to the problems pointed out in <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/06/09/jsf.html" rel="nofollow">Hans Bergsten challenge</a>) to lay out the contents in a simple two column table. The first row shows the use of the<code>jsfExt:set</code>
 tag to store a value into the flash. The second row shows how to get 
things from the flash. When viewing this page the first time, you won't 
see anything in the "Value of #{flash.foo} row" until you press the 
"reload" button in the page. This is because the normal use-case of the 
flash is to store things in this request that will be accessed on the 
next request.</p><span></span><p>If you want to store something in the 
flash for use on this request, click on the "next" button in the sample 
app for an example. In this page we use the "flash.now" syntax, shown 
below in JSP.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="border:1px solid black;"><pre>&lt;jsfExt:set var="#{flash.now.bar}" value="barValue" /&gt;

&lt;h:outputText value="#{flash.now.bar}" /&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><p>By inserting the special
 keyword "now" we tell the flash that this store operation should be 
accessible on this request, rather than the next request. If, during 
processing, you decide you want to promote the value from flash.now to 
the real flash, use "flash.next" as shown on the next page of the sample
 app.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="border:1px solid black;"><pre>&lt;f:verbatim&gt;
&lt;jsfExt:set var="\#{flash.now.buckaroo}" value="banzai" /&gt;
&lt;/f:verbatim&gt;

Value of &lt;code&gt;\#{flash.now.buckaroo}&lt;/code&gt;, should be
&lt;code&gt;banzai&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;h:outputText value="#{flash.now.buckaroo}" /&gt;

Promote buckaroo to stick around for the next request.

&lt;jsfExt:set var="#{flash.keep.buckaroo}" value="#{flash.now.buckaroo}" /&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><p>When you click on the 
next button, you will be shown a page that shows that the value in the 
flash has indeed survived the postback.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="border:1px solid black;"><pre>Show that buckaroo is still here.

&lt;h:outputText value="#{flash.buckaroo}" /&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><p>This is a brief 
introduction to using the flash, a more in-depth article would cover a 
common real-world use-case, such as doing master-detail, and also cover 
the other two entry points to using the flash, the EL API, and direct 
programmatic use.</p><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
