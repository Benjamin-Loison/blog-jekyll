 round out the day's sessions, I attended two from Cameron Purdy of 
Tangosol. His first, on peer to peer, was quite excellent, though I 
expect many found it rudimentary. I, having been so focused on Faces in 
recent years, found it very informative. It was nice to go back to my 
old days as a network programmer at NCSA when he talked about IP 
multicast and its applications to clustering. Following that talk, was 
another with Mr. Purdy, this time joined by Patrick Linksy, of 
SolarMetric. Here they presented their collected wisdom about achieving 
performance and scalability in a J2EE app. This talk was chock full of 
war stories, which I found very interesting. The evening party was quite
 enjoyable, taking place in the private pool area behind the hotel. It 
was reserved exclusively for TSSJS guests and featured fine
