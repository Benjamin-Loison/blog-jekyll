<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>As announced by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.orablogs.com/jjacobi/archives/001574.html" rel="nofollow">Jonas Jacobi in his blog</a>,
 Oracle has donated portions of its ADF Faces component library to the 
MyFaces project. This library is JSF 1.1 based. I'm writing to let you 
know that, due to Oracle's participation in the JSF 1.2 expert group, 
these components have already been tested with Glassfish and run quite 
well under JSF 1.2. Furthermore, the MyFaces tomahawk components also 
run well on Glassfish and JSF 1.2. When the ADF Donation is fully 
integrted into the MyFaces project and available as a separate download 
from the MyFaces implementation, we'll make sure JSF 1.2 and Glassfish 
work with it as well.</p><span></span><p>Ed</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
