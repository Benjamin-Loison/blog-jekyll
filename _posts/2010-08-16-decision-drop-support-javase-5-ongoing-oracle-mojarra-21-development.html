<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>In
 order to bring the testing matrix for Mojarra more in line with 
Oracleâ€™s current engineering investment, we are planning to have all 
future Mojarra builds that are targeting the upcoming JSF 2.1 
specification only support JavaSE 6 and beyond.&nbsp; Any 2.0.X and 1.2 
builds will still continue to be built with Java SE 5.</p>&nbsp; <p>If you have any comments about this decision, please let me know here.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><span class="technoratitag"> Technorati Tags:<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p>&nbsp; </div>
