<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>This
 quick blog entry is just to advertise the availability of the Proposed 
Final Draft of JSF 2.2 (JSR-344). You may download the draft of the spec
 at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr344/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr344/index.html</a>&gt;. You may try out the implementation by dropping this maven GAV into the <code>modules</code> directory of GlassFish 3.1.2.2: <code><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.glassfish%22%20AND%20a%3A%22javax.faces%22%20AND%20v%3A%222.2.0-m11%22?customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">org.glassfish:javax.faces:2.2.0-m11</a></code>.
 It will also work on Tomcat 7, but none of the features that require 
CDI, such as Faces Flows, will be available. Or you can simply download 
b80 or later from the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/4.0/promoted/glassfish-4.0-web-b80.zip" rel="nofollow">GlassFish 4.0 promoted builds</a>.</p><span></span><p>Please submit your feedback to the "users" list accessible from &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jsf-spec.java.net/lists/" rel="nofollow">http://jsf-spec.java.net/lists/</a>&gt;.
 I'd like to extend a special thanks to Leonardo Uribe and Frank Caputo 
for their valuable contributions to the spec effort thus far.</p></div>
