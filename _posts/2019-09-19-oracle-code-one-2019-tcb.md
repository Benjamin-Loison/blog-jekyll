If you attended the JCP party Monday this week and were able to hear
[Ken Kousen](http://www.kousenit.com/) singing "Takin' Care of
Business", you may have noticed the lyrics were different.  If you are
curious, here they are.

## Takin' Care of Business, Java Edition

```
you get up Tuesday morning
with the build system warning
get the vpn into the server

You identify the systems
check the daemons, logs and pids,
and the build, it's not lookin pretty

There's a NullPointerException
From some broken introspection
And the findbugs report
is looking gritty

so you start to get annoyed
at the hackers we employed
but they like to work at java all day

And you've been takin care of business
every day
takin care of business
every way, you been
takin care of business
it's all right
takin care of business
debugging overtime, work out.

jam

So understand the ClassLoader
if you wanna be a coder
and the code you write runs without an error

Get an open source debugger
and you'll be a Java slugger
and all the bugs will run away in terror

People see you havin fun
Just a codin in the sun
Tell them that you like it that way

It's the bugs that we avoid
and we're all well employed
We love to work at java all day
and we be

And you've been takin care of business
every day
takin care of business
every way, you been
takin care of business
it's all right
takin care of business
debugging overtime, work out.

jam

drum and clap break

take good care
of our business
every day
every way

jam

repeat first verse

you get up Tuesday morning
with the build system warning
get the vpn into the server

You identify the systems
check the daemons, logs and pids,
and the build, it's not lookin pretty

There's a NullPointerException
From some broken introspection
And the findbugs report
is looking gritty

so you start to get annoyed
at the hackers we employed
but they like to work at java all day

And you've been takin care of business
every day
takin care of business
every way, you been
takin care of business
it's all right
takin care of business
debugging overtime, work out.
