 JSRs both provide a number of annotations that are useful to enterprise
 Java developers. This blog entry examines the use of two from EJB3 that
 I feel really should be in Common Annotations:<code>@PostConstruct</code> and <code>@PreDestroy</code>.</p><span></span><p>Let's review the purpose of these annotations.</p><span></span><dl><dt><code>@PostConstruct</code></dt><dd><pre> * Designates a method to receive a callback during creation of a
 * session bean or message driven bean instance.
</pre></dd><dt><code>@PreDestroy</code></dt><dd><pre> * Designates a method to receive a callback before a session bean or 
 * message driven instance is destroyed.
</pre></dd></dl><span></span><p>These annotations are useful for any 
container managed instance, not just session beans or message driven 
beans. This blog shows how I leveraged the new <code>ManagedBeanFactory</code>
 SPI in Sun's implementation of JSF technology to create a prototype 
that allows JSF authors to use these annotations in their managed beans.
 I'm doing this to make the case to move these two annotations out of 
EJB and into Common Annotations. If this is done, it's easy to see that 
using this feature will find its way into a future version of the JSF 
spec.</p><span></span><p>The running code for this example is checked into the "components" jsf-demo in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">JSF project on java.net</a>. You have to get a nightly build more recent than 30 August 2005 to get a build with this code in it, though.</p><span></span><h2>Details</h2><span></span><p>The <code>com.sun.faces.spi.ManagedBeanFactoryWrapper</code>class
 in the Sun JSF implementation allows the user to decorate the internal 
implementation class used to instantiate managed beans such that the 
creation process can be intercepted and methods annotated with <code>@PostConstruct</code> can be called. The listeners for request, session, and <code>ServletContext</code>classes in the Servlet API can be used to intercept destruction events and call managed bean methods annotated with<code>@PreDestroy</code>.</p><span></span><p>The
 following two classes leverage these hook points to implement the 
feature. The classes are presented in the form of a JSF project <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/faq.html#change_bundle" rel="nofollow">change-bundle</a>To see the real code, please <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/faq.html#Code_checkout" rel="nofollow">get the source from java.net</a>.</p><span></span><h3><code>A components/src/java/components/model/LifecycleManagedBeanFactory.java</code></h3><span></span><p><code>This class leverages the decorator pattern provided by the<code>ManagedBeanFactory</code> SPI to decorate the<code>newInstance()</code> method and inject calling the<code>@PostConstruct</code> method on the ManagedBean instance being created, if present. It also establishes a contract with the<code>LifecycleManagedBeanListener</code> to call the<code>@PreDestroy</code> annotated methods, if present, when the time comes.</code></p><span></span><h3><code>A components/src/java/components/model/LifecycleManagedBeanListener.java</code></h3><span></span><p>This class implements <code>ServletRequestListener, HttpSessionListener</code>, and <code>ServletContextListener</code>and uses the <code>*Destroyed</code> methods to look into the list established by the <code>LifecycleManagedBeanFactory</code> for this scope and call any appropriately annotated methods.</p><span></span><h3><code>M components/src/java/demo/model/RepeaterBean.java</code></h3><span></span><p>annotate some methods to be called.</p><span></span><h3><code>M components/web/WEB-INF/web.xml</code></h3><span></span><p>Declare the above <code>LifecycleManagedBeanListener</code>.</p><span></span><h3><code>M components/build.xml</code></h3><span></span><p>Declare a compile time dependency on<code>jsf-impl.jar</code>.</p><span></span><h2>Summary</h2><span></span><p>It
 could be said that using annotations in this way is just making up for 
Java's lack of a proper destructor, as one has in Objective C and C++. 
However, using annotations in this way is far more flexible than 
constructors and destructors, while not adding any conceptual burden for
 the new developer. New developers can simply avoid using annotations 
until they feel ready to do so. Another factor to consider is that the 
servlet API could be enhanced to automatically call methods annotated 
with these or similar annotations when objects are added to the request,
 session, or application scope. I hope I've demonstrated the usefulness 
of these two annotations outside of EJB and made a good case for moving 
them out to Common Annotations.</p><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></div>
