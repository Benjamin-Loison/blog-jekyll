<p>I am honored to speak in such esteemed company with my fellow
NullPointers <a href="http://twitter.com/javafxpert">James Weaver</a>
and <a href="http://twitter.com/frankgreco">Frank Greco</a> at the generous
invitation of my good friend, and also
NullPointer <a href="http://twitter.com/fguime">Freddy Guime</a>.  James
and Frank are collaborating on a machine learning related talk, while I
am sharing some things I've learned in using Mesos/Marathon as a
desktop-to-datacenter-to-cloud runtime environment.  I only have 30
minutes so I am putting the slides on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/EdBurns6/chicago-jug-goto-meetup">SlideShare</a> and the demo source
code is available <a href="/blog/downloads/20170404-cjug-goto-meetup.zip">here</a>.</p>
