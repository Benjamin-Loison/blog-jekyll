<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>In an <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2014/02/18/eds-devnexus-2014-picks" rel="nofollow">earlier blog entry</a> I listed my picks for DevNexus 2014.&nbsp; This blog entry summarizes my notes from this show.</p>&nbsp; <p>I
 corroborate the common wisdom about DevNexus being a very well run 
show.&nbsp; This was my first time presenting and I found the talk 
selection on the first day to have the right mix of diversity and depth 
for the working developer.&nbsp; The second day was much less compelling
 for me, personally, so I'll just report on the first day.</p>&nbsp; <p>09:00 Welcome and Sven Peters Keynote, Hall A</p>&nbsp; <p>From
 the buzz around his provocative "Don't use git" meme, I expected a 
great wake-up presentation.&nbsp; Sven did not disappoint, though I 
confess to already being a much bigger fan of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/Atlascharlie1" rel="nofollow">Charlie</a> than the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pando.com/2013/07/08/original-github-octocat-designer-simon-oxley-on-his-famous-creation-i-dont-remember-drawing-it/" rel="nofollow">Octocat</a>. This presentation was a breezy feel-good about not being afraid to be a good developer.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>10:30 Intro to Vert.x 2.0 Burr Sutter, Room 103</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>I
 wasn't able to see as much of this as I would have 
liked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because I was still finishing up my slides
 for 4pm.&nbsp; As far as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vert.x, Burr stated it
 bears only a superficial resemblance to&nbsp;&nbsp; node.js: that it is
 designed to leverage asynchronous realities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The unit of abstraction in Vert.x is a "verticle".&nbsp; He 
also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned it was a "micro-services" 
framework.&nbsp; In spite of Burr's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assertion, I
 still think that Vert.x is a good place to start 
for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those that want some of the node.js goodness
 but withut leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>13:00 AngularJS Bootcamp, Raju Gandhi, Ballroom F</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>This
 is part 1 of a two-part workshop-type session. 
AngularJS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was also recommended on the JavaEE 8 
developer survey.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>I only caught the
 tail end of this due to hallway chat with Burr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I sought to validate my value proposition for my UI talk 
tomorrow:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the combining of the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2014/02/25/just-spoonful-java-ee-makes-angularjs-localization-problem-go-away" rel="nofollow">I18N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 feature of JSF with AngularJS would bring unique value not 
present&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in AngularJS alone</a>.&nbsp; Raju 
agreed this was worth mentioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one was a
 very good one to see, and I'd recommend looking 
at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the video if it ever comes out. (Well, it's 
nearly five months later&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's still not out,
 so I wouldn't hold your breath.)</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>14:30 Node.js intro, Ted Neward, Ballroom B</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Ted's
 an excellent speaker.&nbsp; The first half of this talk was just 
an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Intro to JavaScript".&nbsp; This one is 
worth seeing the video for as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well.&nbsp; I 
wasn't able to stay for the node.js specific part because 
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted to get in the zone for my talk.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>17:30 Mobile Frameworks Smackdown, Ballroom A</p> <p>This
 one was very unmemorable, though I did hand my business 
card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a lady who was asking for a solution to 
write Java apps once and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have them appear on 
Android and IOS devices as native apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Naturally, I told her about <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/adf-mobile/overview/index.html" rel="nofollow">Oracle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADF mobile</a>.</p>
