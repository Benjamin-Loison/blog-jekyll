<div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I
 meant to mark this anniversary when it came up, but missed doing 
so.&nbsp; It's been ten years, so what's an additional five weeks going 
to mean.&nbsp; On 28 June 2004 I announced, with <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2004/06/welcome_to_the.html" rel="nofollow">my first entry on this blog</a>,
 the first part of Java to be released into open-source.&nbsp; That 
initial release of the JavaServer Faces reference implementation was the
 first step in the journey towards opening Java that completed in April 
2009 with the removal of the last binary plug from the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://openjdk.java.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenJDK</a>.&nbsp;
 For my part, I've been blessed to work on open source technology all 
these years and have enjoyed many collaborations with the best software 
development community in the world, the Java community.&nbsp; I hope we 
all can continue to create the future of Java in the coming years.</p> </div>
