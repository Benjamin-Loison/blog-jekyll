<h3>Swiss JSF User Group Formed</h3>

<span class="ltcaption1">Posted by <b>edburns</b> on August 01, 2007 at 10:56 AM</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2007/08/swiss_jsf_user.html">Permalink</a>

<br/><br/>
<p>
Because I was presenting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/">MCP</a> at
the first ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://jazoon.com/">Jazoon conference</a>, my
friend and expert JSF Developer Alexander Jesse invited me to speak at
the first ever JSF User Group meeting.  The meeting was held at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.credit-suisse.com/" target="_">Credit
Suisse</a> office in Z&uuml;rich on the evening of the last day of the
Jazoon conference.</p>

<p>Credit Suisse is the largest financial institution to go public with
its investment in JSF, though I have it on good authority that Deutsche
Bank, and Oesterreichische Kontrollbank also have made significant
investments in JSF.  Mr. Jesse's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentations/wp/1400">presentation</a>
at Jazoon detailed how Credit Suisse has achieved significant advances
in developer productivity, UI uniformity, and maintainability by
creating a custom JSF component library specific to the needs of Credit
Suisse IT developers.  Mr. Jesse printed up flyers announcing the JSF
user group meeting and these were distributed in the Sun and Credit
Suisse booths in the exhibitor area, as well as at every one of the five
JSF related presentations at Jazoon.</p>

<p>The primary goals of this inaugural meeting was to decide if there
was a need for a JSF user group in Switzerland, should the group be a
special interest group (SIG) within <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.jugs.ch/" target="_">JUGs</a> or a standalone group, and how often should the
group meet.  Secondarily, Mr. Jesse and I would present some fun
technical content, not found anywhere else at Jazoon.</p>

<h3>Vacation: Backwards Compatibility Story</h3>

<br/><br/>
<p>Back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.uiuc.edu/">college</a> I spent many hours
of my copious Freshman year free time playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHX_Attack_Chopper">LHX</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://share-it.gatech.edu/author/will">Will Day's</a> PC.  At the
time, all I had was an Apple //c, which was already behind the times by
then.  As you can read in the Wikipedia entry, this was a flight
simulation game.  The thing I remember most was the "missle-cam" view,
where you could fire a TOW missle and then switch to the missle's eye
view, where you controlled the missle until it hit the target.  Well,
during my recent vacation, I decided to see if I could find a way to
play it on a current computer.  Sure enough, the thing still runs
unmodified.  No emulator or anything.</p>

<p>As we're starting up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">JSF 2.0</a> I'll keep this
runtime backwards compatibility firmly in mind as I corral debate and
discussion on new features.</p>

<h3>JSF 2.0 EG Kick Off Meeting: Buy a Feature</h3>

<span class="ltcaption1">Posted by <b>edburns</b> on May 14, 2007 at 07:59 PM</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2007/05/jsf_20_eg_kick.html">Permalink</a>

<br/><br/>
<p>Even though we haven't yet officially filed the JSR for JSF 2.0,
we're darn close, and I felt we could not afford to miss the opportunity
to have a JSF 2.0 Expert Group kick off meeting at JavaOne this year.
Once again we were blessed with a great turnout (19 people, including a
special visit from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Jonathan
Schwartz</a>, see <a href="#roster">the roster</a>).  Instead of
spending time gathering requriements or kibbutzing, I decided the
requirements we have already gathered were good enough for now.  Our
first order of business as the JSF 2.0 Expert Group was to prioritize
these requirements so we can build a schedule.</p>

<p>To complete this exercise, we used one of Luke Hohmann's Innovation
Games: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.innovationgames.com/Game/BuyAFeature.aspx">Buy a
Feature</a>.  From Luke's description: </p>

<blockquote>
Create a list of features with an estimated cost. The cost can be
development effort or something else; although the cost can be the
actual cost you intend to charge for the feature, this is usually not
required. Customers buy features that they want in the next
release. Make certain that some features are priced high enough that no
one customer can buy them. This will help motivate negotiations between
customers as to which features are most important. Encourage customers
to pool their money to buy especially important / expensive
features. Works best with 4-5 customers in a group, so that you can
create more opportunities for customers to pool their money through
negotiating.
</blockquote>

<p>"Buy a Feature" is just one of the great games in Luke's book, <u><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Games-Creating-Breakthrough-Collaborative/dp/0321437292/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8440464-8460023?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1179146533&amp;sr=8-1">Innovation
Games: Creating Breakthrough Products Through Collaborative Play
</a></u>.  </p>

<p>Exercising spec lead authority, I looked at 1) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/proposals/JSF-2_0-draft.html">the
JSR draft</a>, 2) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Jsf2RequirementsScratchpad">the
Requirements Scratchpad</a>, and 3) Alex Smirnov's requirements
document, and picked 15 requirements using a weighting algorithm.  I
assigned prices to each based on how much spec effort I thought it would
take to specify each feature.  I took the final 15 into the meeting.
JCP Experts being JCP Experts, there was some disagreement over my
inclusions and omissions from the list.  I pushed aside this
disagreement, for the most part, and only allowed two changes to the
menu at the meeting.  The actual menu used at the meeting follows.
</p>

<table border="1">

<tbody><tr>

<th>
Feature Name
</th>

<th>
Feature
</th>

<th>
Cost (USD)
</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Facelets
</td>



<td>Real world, production view description technology, including
templating: include something influenced by Facelets, JSFTemplating or
Tiles in the specification.  Also includes component aggregation: allow
development of true JSF custom component with little or no Java coding
by aggregating existing simple components.
</td>

<td>165</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Zero Deployment Time
</td>

<td>Eliminate the "deployment step". All the artifacts that comprise a JSF
application can be modified while the application is running. This will
bring the responsiveness people have been used to with iterative JSP
development to the JSF developer. One design idea for this is to allow
JSF artifacts to be authored in Script.
</td>

<td>100</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>EZComp
</td>

<td>Make it really easy to create JSF custom components.
</td>

<td>100
</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Ajax
</td>



<td>Expand the request processing lifecycle to be aware of Ajax. This may
include describing a small developer-contract footprint JavaScript
library as part of the JavaServer Faces specification.  Enable
components to have a client based lifecycle in addition to, or instead
of the server based request/response lifecycle. Such a client based
lifecycle would enable use-cases such as drag-and-drop, master-detail
and sub-dialogs on a single page interface web application.
</td>

<td>80</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td>Errors
</td>



<td>Better Error reporting, like what you get with Tapestry (also in
JSR-252-EG, where it was said: any time there is an error in *any* part
of the lifecycle, the user should see not just a cryptic stack trace,
but also the component - including file and line number - that triggered
the problem, the EL expression that was being evaluated - including the
part of the EL expression that triggered the problem,
etc. Diagnosability for state saving is also important. On this point,
Gavin King wants to have centralized error handling, with an
interception point, perhaps using navigation rules, to help handle
errors.)
</td>

<td>80</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>MegaListeners
</td>



<td>You want to be able to add listeners for various kinds of lifecycle
application events.  Maybe, "call this each time something validates,"
or "call this after everything successfully validates."  "before JSF
initializes", "after JSF is done initializing",
</td>

<td>50</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Convention over Configuration
</td>



<td>Allow for "zero configuration" web applications. No faces-config.xml, no
web.xml. 
</td>

<td>50</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Mostly GET
</td>



<td>Allow for bookmarkable JSF pages. More broadly, if HTTP GET can be used,
it should be used.
</td>

<td>80</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>AnnotationFest
</td>



<td>Leverage annotations to declare JSF artifacts (components, managed
beans, navigation rules, etc) to the runtime.
</td>

<td>25</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Declarative Rendering
</td>



<td>Declarative Renderers, otherwise known as Renderers without resorting to
out.println().
</td>

<td>25</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Fix State Saving
</td>



<td>Re-do UIComponent state saving with a view towards making stateless
components the default.
</td>

<td>80</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Skins
</td>



<td>"Skinning", or "Themeing" of components.  This also would include
per-user personalizations that could be applied to the components.
</td>

<td>60</td>

</tr>




<tr>

<td>Singleton Precedence
</td>



<td>ViewHandler (and other parts of JSF) ordering when there are multiple
implementations -- also perhaps restrict to certain URLs
</td>

<td>40</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Validation++
</td>



<td>Decent inter-component and form-level validation
</td>

<td>15</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Programmatic Config Access
</td>



<td>Programmatic access to and modification of faces-config.xml and web.xml,
perhaps as a DOM instance.

<h3>Playing the Game</h3>

<p>We broke down into groups of four, and Roger Kitain, Dennis Byrne and
I played the role of feature retailers.  Dennis Byrne, who works for
world-famous XP Consulting firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/">ThoughtWorks</a> remarked that
his firm uses similar techniques to discover the preferences of clients.
From his experience in playing such games, he was very pleased with the
amount of high quality discussion in the groups, and so was I.  These
people clearly had strong opinions about web application frameworks, but
at the same time were professional in sharing them.  The collaboration
aspect of the game was a success, which in itself is a good outcome to a
JCP Expert Group kick-off meeting.</p>

<p>After each of the four groups had completed their shopping, I
collected the results which are summarized in the following table.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There were some problems with the exercise.  Ever the inveterate
gamer, Howard Lewis-Ship pointed out (sadly, after the exercise was
complete) that we had given too much money to each individual, which
under-constrained the participants and thus masked their true feelings.
This was an honest miscalculation, which I deeply regret.  In addition,
participants complained of a lack of consistent level of detail among
the menu items.  Some were very low level and specific, others high
level and generic.  This required each group to re-define the generic
items for their own purposes, and naturally each one did it in their own
way.  Each menu item was not cleanly disjoint from all the others,
leading to a participant to have to choose between items that both
possesed <strong>some</strong> of what they were looking for.  In spite
of these problems, I consider the exercise a success, for the experience
in playing it for future meetings, and, to a lesser extent, for the hard
data produced.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>Finally, I was delighted to have bumped into Jonathan Schwartz in the
halls of the Sun building where the meeting was being held.  Having
known Jonathan from my days at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005652/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_Design">Lighthouse
Design</a>, and knowing that deeply understands developers, I felt
confident in asking him to stop by the meeting and thank the EG members
for donating their time to the Java Community Process.  He went one step
further and hung out for a little bit collecting data on how well the EG
members felt the JCP was working.</p>
