<p>One of the great things about working at Oracle is the high calibre
of one's coworkers, and one of the best is my
colleague <a href="http://www.manorrock.com /blog/">Manfred Riem</a>.
Manfred shared this <a href="http://ujug.org/about/">UJUG</a> recording
of <a href="https://twitter.com/neal4d">Neal Ford's</a> talk at their
March meeting:
&lt;<a href="https://www.periscope.tv/UtahJava/1OdJrgAkgRnxX?t=11m59s">https://www.periscope.tv/UtahJava/1OdJrgAkgRnxX?t=11m59s</a>&gt;.
  This blog post covers my notes and impressions of the session.</p>

"Bathe in the absurdity of the statement 'Microservices is a popular
architectural style".

Three parts

What problem are we trying to solve?
Characteristics
Engineering Practices

<h2>Introduction: What came before Microservices</h2>

Microservices cannot be divorced from the engineering practices, such as
DevOps.

Contrast Microservices with what came before: SOA.  Microservices is a label
not description.  Contrast to SOA: which is gargantuan.

SOA: abstract enterprise-level coarse-grained services.

Implementation of these services: reusable as possible.  Enable the
business users to compose the services because the services have been
written so well to be reusable.

Some one-off services as well: authentication, identity, etc.

Message Bus: really important to enable this reuse.

Why build these?  "Resume driven development"?  Goal: maximize reuse.
Maximize canonicalitym aka DRY.  Aside: this appears to be a
manifestation of Eric Evan's UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE concept.

Constraints of SOA: incremental change is hard with SOA.  The context in
which SOA grew up.  Predated Open Source.  Everything was proprietary.
OS were very heavyweight: resources and licenses.  Operation was very
complex.

"<a href="http://nealford.com/memeagora/2015/03/30/architecture_is_abstract_until_operationalized.html">Architecture
is an abstraction until you operationalize it.</a>"

I like how he explicitly called out that a key aspect of the
architecture is how it interacts with the environment around it.
Analogy of taking the deployed system, unplugging it, putting it in the
closet, waiting a year, and plugging it back in.  This brings in the
dimension of time (2D -> 3D -> 4D) to the architecture.  This is what he
means by operationalized.

<h2>What problem are we trying to solve with Microservices?</h2>

<p>Plug for Evans DDD and Vaughn Vernon Implementing DDD.</p>

<p>Defines the Bounded Context idea.  It's a business process, such as
  "customer checkout".  No one outside the context is able to know the
  impl details of the inside.  Combine this with Humble and Farley
  (Continuous Delivery) and you get the Microservices Architecture.</p>

<p>Diagram that shows API layer.  This is optional, but acts as a
  facade that imposes the bounded context boundary.  It is not a part
  of an ESB.  This is where he delivers the "everyone provides their
  own persistence" requirement. </p>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>

<p>Monoliths vs. Microservices.  Difference in how the achieve scale.
Monoliths, everyone shares the same stuff, so you achieve scale through
clustering.  In Microservices, how you achieve scale is to add more
instances.  This is a manifestation of the importance if putting things
  in the right place.  In the SOA: scaling is an architectural
  problem.  Really, it should be an ops problem.</p>

<p>Products, not Projects.  This is the Conway's law thing.  You build
  it, you run it.  Teams do not span products.  Teams maintain the same
  product for their lifetime.  This responsibility makes people confront
  the consequences of their actions.  <code>It eliminates the ability
  to <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-externalized-costs.htm">externalize
  costs</a></code>.  He notes as an aside that propogating model changes
  across services is very hard, though.</p>

<p>"Inverse Conway Movement" Organize teams by bounded contexts, rather
  than skillset.  Accept Conway's law as a fact of life, build teams
  accordingly.</p>

<p>Smart endpoints and dumb pipes.  REST or messaging (what about
  gRPC?) Whatever you choose, you do have to standardize on it.
  Embrace polyglot solutions where sensible.  (Plugs Sam Newman's
  book).</p>

<p>Aside on the challenges of "everyone provides their own persistence"
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>
  vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">BASE</a>
  (CAP Theorem).  "We have made our users think that transactions are a
  natural part of the universe, but they are not."  Starbucks example.
  ATM example: batch reconciliation.  He takes pot shots at the need for
  transactions, saying "maybe seats on an airplane" need them.  I
  disagree.  Transactions are useful in any case where there is a lot of
  contention: event tickets, auctions, manufacturing automation and
  more.  But, with Microservices, you want to try to avoid transactions.
  That I agree with.  <code>When defining bounded contexts, when you get
  to the point when you say, "if we get any smaller than that, we'll
  have to do a distributed transaction," that's when you stop
  and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/1cxxk1/whats_your_favorite_rendition_of_take_a_step_back/">take
  a step back</a> and that's where you have a boundary.</code>  This is
  more reliable than your class diagram.</p>

<p>Decentralized governance: an aside that you can change your
  persistence within a bounded context and no-one outside it cares.
  Without this, because everyone shares everything, we have to choose an
  RDBMS that works for the aspect of the system that has the hardest
  problems, while the rest of the system may not need that much
  power.  Same for all aspects (MQ, etc).  Everyone is suffering from
  the maximum complexity.  Microservices allows more fine grained
  rightsizing.</p>

<p>Brief plug for CICD.</p>

<p>Microservices tries to avoid having something like a "customer
  service".  Rather, each service has its own notion of customer.  It
  turns out this is not as bad as you might think, because the right
  decomposition of bounded contexts means that the notion of customer
  can be conveyed as messages, without defining a customer as a
  service.  </p>

<p>"The more resuable code it is, the less usable it is."  In other
  words, the more cases it serves, the less it is for one case.
  Mentioned the old IBM San Francisco Project, which gave birth to
  J2EE.  Neal felt it was the stupidest idea ever.  Well, I don't know
  about that, but the idea did have very big consequences.</p>

<p>Service orchestration.  This is necessary because we don't have
  transactions.  This
  is <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html">Chris
  Richardson's saga concept</a>.  </p>

<h3>Benefits of Microservices</h3>

<p>Maximize easy evolution.  Make changes without breaking
  stuff.  <code>Microservices is the first architecture style developed
  after the acceptance of continuous delivery (aka DevOps)</code>.
  Also allows you to optimize only what matters.</p>

<p>Tends to be asynchronous from birth.  This allows amazon to stay
  within their boredom threshold, the point where users will lose
  interest and go somewhere else, which is lost money.  "Prefer timely
  partial over slow complete".</p>

<p>Integration vs. disintegration.  "Complected deployments" to
  intertwine things.  Components are deployed and features are released.
  This allows us to monitor traffic and see which features are actually
  needed, allowing empirical determination of which features you can
  safely disintegrate.  (Economically, because features are teams, this
  also means which employees you can lay off because they are not
  delivering value.  I argue this is a more compelling reason for
  companies.)</p>

<p>How big?  The more services you have, the lower you drive down your
  risk per service release.  But this does not address the complexity
  tax of having all those services.</p>

<h3>Engineering Practices</h3>

<p>Design for failure, monitoring.  Monitoring is harder in
  Microservices, but at least there is good tool support: ELK, etc.
  This includes log aggregation.</p>

<p>Mention of "synthetic transactions".  This plus monitoring is how
  you debug.</p>

<p>Mention of "correlation ids".  Again, debugging.</p>

<p><a href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it">Release It!</a>
  "Everything in this book is considered bible in this world" Circuit
  Breakers, bulkheads, timeouts.</p>

<p><code>Engineering consistency.  Share nothing except: how the services
  integrate (REST vs message bus vs. RPC).  The other is actual system
  services technologies: monitoring, logging, identity.  This is the
  "service template" idea.  Dropwizard or SpringBoot help with
    this.</code></p>

<p>Testing.  The testing pyramid.  Unit, Integration, Component,
  End-to-end, exploratory.  Unit testing: sociable (real live objects)
  and solitary (mocks).  Integration testing: gateway, protocol level.
  Database integration.  Component testing: build a diagnostic mode into
  your services.  Inproctester or plasma.  Consumer Driven Contracts:
  Each endpoint defines the contract that the other side must adhere to
  and codifies that into a test, which is a release gate for the other
  endpoint.  This appears to be the microservices equivalent of an IDE
  alerting you that when you change the signature of a method all the
  callsites that now break.  Pact, Pacto, Janus.  Implicit assumption
  that you have sufficient engineering maturity.  Eveyone is good at
  writing tests, keeping the build green, etc.  End-to-end testing:
  focus on personas and user journeys.  </p>

<p>Deployment technologies.  As advanced as Docker containers or as
  simple as executable jars.</p>

<p>Don't let changes build up, get things into production as quickly as
possible.  With all the other CD stuff, deploying is actually anti
  risky, since you have feature toggles 01:15:55</p>
